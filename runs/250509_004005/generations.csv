3,deepseek,What are the best practices for creating a viral trend on Instagram?,,20.971683740615845,"Creating a viral trend on Instagram requires a mix of creativity, timing, engagement, and strategic execution. Here are the best practices to maximize your chances:  ### **1. Understand Your Audience**    - **Know their interests**: Research what your target audience engages with (memes, challenges, tutorials, etc.).    - **Leverage trends**: Use Instagram’s **Explore Page** and **Reels trends** to see what’s currently popular.    - **Engage with niche communities**: Participate in discussions and trends within your niche.  ### **2. Create Highly Shareable Content**    - **Short, engaging videos (Reels)**: Instagram prioritizes Reels, so keep them **under 15 seconds** for maximum retention.    - **Relatable & emotional hooks**: Use humor, surprise, nostalgia, or inspiration to trigger shares.    - **Challenges & trends**: Jump on existing trends (e.g., dance challenges, transitions) or create your own.    - **User-generated content (UGC)**: Encourage followers to recreate your trend (e.g., ""Put a Finger Down"" or ""Get Ready With Me"").  ### **3. Optimize for Instagram’s Algorithm**    - **Post at peak times**: Use Instagram Insights to find when your audience is most active.    - **Use trending sounds & hashtags**: Viral Reels often use trending audio clips and relevant hashtags (#Viral, #Trending).    - **Engage in the first hour**: Reply to comments quickly to boost engagement signals.  ### **4. Leverage Influencers & Collaborations**    - **Partner with micro-influencers**: They have highly engaged audiences that can amplify your trend.    - **Duets & Stitches**: Encourage others to react to your content, increasing reach.    - **Shoutouts & tags**: Collaborate with creators who can repost or participate.  ### **5. Encourage Participation & Virality**    - **Call-to-action (CTA)**: Ask users to ""Try this and tag us!"" or ""Comment your answer below.""    - **Make it easy to replicate**: Simple trends (e.g., photo filters, hashtag challenges) spread faster.    - **Reward engagement**: Feature the best responses on your page to incentivize participation.  ### **6. Cross-Promote & Amplify**    - **Share on Stories & IG Live**: Drive traffic to your trend by teasing it in Stories.    - **Post on other platforms**: Share snippets on TikTok, Twitter, or YouTube Shorts to attract new audiences.    - **Engage with similar trends**: Comment on related posts to increase visibility.  ### **7. Analyze & Adapt**    - **Track performance**: Use Instagram Insights to see what works (saves, shares, comments).    - **Iterate quickly**: If a trend starts gaining traction, double down with similar content.  ### **Examples of Viral Instagram Trends**    - **""Silent Disco"" (People dancing with no music)**    - **""Photo Dump"" (Casual photo carousels)**    - **""Get Ready With Me (GRWM)""**    - **""POV"" (Point-of-view skits)**    - **""AI Filter Challenges"" (e.g., Bold Glamour filter reactions)**  ### **Final Tip: Be Authentic**    - Trends work best when they feel **organic**—"

As we gather here today, we are surrounded by a world that is increasingly interconnected, yet often fragmented along lines of difference. We live in a society where people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and identities are coming together in unprecedented ways, and yet, we still struggle to understand and appreciate the value that this diversity brings.  From the boardroom to the classroom, from the workplace to the community, diversity is a reality that is shaping our experiences, our interactions, and our outcomes. And yet, despite its ubiquity, diversity remains a concept that is often misunderstood, undervalued, or even resisted. We may acknowledge its importance in theory, but in practice, we often struggle to create environments that are truly inclusive, equitable, and just.  Today, I want to challenge us to think more deeply about the importance of diversity, and to explore the ways in which it can enrich our lives, our organizations, and our society as a whole. We'll examine the business case for diversity, and explore the ways in which diverse teams and organizations are better equipped to innovate, adapt, and thrive in a rapidly changing world. We'll also discuss the social and moral imperatives that underlie the importance of diversity, and explore the ways in which it can help to break down barriers, build bridges, and foster a more just and equitable society.  Through personal anecdotes, data-driven insights, and real-world examples, I'll make the case for why diversity matters, and why it's essential that we prioritize it in all aspects of our lives. My goal is not simply to persuade you of the importance of diversity, but to inspire you to become active participants in creating a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable world. So let's get started on this important conversation, and explore together the many ways in which diversity can enrich our lives, and our world."""

Today, we will delve into the importance of diversity and the myriad benefits it brings to our lives, our communities, and our global society.  In a world that is increasingly interconnected, it is essential to understand and appreciate the rich tapestry of human differences that make up our global community. Diversity, in its broadest sense, encompasses a multitude of dimensions, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, religion, and socio-economic status. Each of these dimensions contributes unique perspectives, ideas, and experiences that, when combined, foster innovation, creativity, and resilience.  The importance of diversity is not merely a matter of moral or ethical principle. It is a practical necessity in an era of rapid technological advancement, globalization, and complex challenges that require innovative solutions. A diverse workforce, for instance, has been shown to drive innovation, improve decision-making, and enhance problem-solving capabilities. In a world where competition is fierce, and the pace of change is relentless, these advantages can make the difference between success and failure.  Moreover, diversity fosters empathy, understanding, and respect among people from different backgrounds. By promoting an environment where everyone feels valued and included, we can build stronger, more cohesive communities that are better equipped to navigate the challenges of the 21st century.  However, despite the numerous benefits of diversity, we still face significant challenges in achieving true inclusivity and equality. Discrimination, prejudice, and bias continue to limit opportunities for many, and perpetuate inequalities that undermine the potential of our societies. It is our collective responsibility to challenge these barriers and work towards a more inclusive world.  In this talk, we will explore the many facets of diversity, the benefits it brings, and the challenges we face in achieving true inclusivity. We will discuss practical strategies for promoting diversity and inclusion, and the role each of us can play in creating a more equitable and vibrant society.  I invite you to join me on this journey of discovery, as we delve into the importance of diversity and the transformative power it holds for our personal lives, our communities, and our world. Together, let us embrace the richness of our differences and work towards a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.

3,llama_rag,What are the best practices for creating a viral trend on Instagram?,"Social media generates a prodigious wealth of real-time content at an incessant rate. From all the content that people create and share, only a few topics manage to attract enough attention to rise to the top and become temporal trends which are displayed to users. The question of what factors cause the formation and persistence of trends is an important one that has not been answered yet. In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending topics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation, persistence and decay of trends. We also demonstrate empirically how factors such as user activity and number of followers do not contribute strongly to trend creation and its propagation. In fact, we find that the resonance of the content with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing trends.

In addition to more personalized content feeds, some leading social media platforms give a prominent role to content that is more widely popular. On Twitter, ""trending topics"" identify popular topics of conversation on the platform, thereby promoting popular content which users might not have otherwise seen through their network. Hence, ""trending topics"" potentially play important roles in influencing the topics users engage with on a particular day. Using two carefully constructed data sets from India and Turkey, we study the effects of a hashtag appearing on the trending topics page on the number of tweets produced with that hashtag. We specifically aim to answer the question: How many new tweeting using that hashtag appear because a hashtag is labeled as trending? We distinguish the effects of the trending topics page from network exposure and find there is a statistically significant, but modest, return to a hashtag being featured on trending topics. Analysis of the types of users impacted by trending topics shows that the feature helps less popular and new users to discover and spread content outside their network, which they otherwise might not have been able to do.

Searching for influential spreaders in complex networks is an issue of great significance for applications across various domains, ranging from the epidemic control, innovation diffusion, viral marketing, social movement to idea propagation. In this paper, we first display some of the most important theoretical models that describe spreading processes, and then discuss the problem of locating both the individual and multiple influential spreaders respectively. Recent approaches in these two topics are presented. For the identification of privileged single spreaders, we summarize several widely used centralities, such as degree, betweenness centrality, PageRank, k-shell, etc. We investigate the empirical diffusion data in a large scale online social community -- LiveJournal. With this extensive dataset, we find that various measures can convey very distinct information of nodes. Of all the users in LiveJournal social network, only a small fraction of them involve in spreading. For the spreading processes in LiveJournal, while degree can locate nodes participating in information diffusion with higher probability, k-shell is more effective in finding nodes with large influence.

5,llama_rag,Describe the key elements that make a motivational speech impactful for a global audience.,"One problem that every presenter faces when delivering a public discourse is how to hold the listeners' attentions or to keep them involved. Therefore, many studies in conversation analysis work on this issue and suggest qualitatively con-structions that can effectively lead to audience's applause. To investigate these proposals quantitatively, in this study we an-alyze the transcripts of 2,135 TED Talks, with a particular fo-cus on the rhetorical devices that are used by the presenters for applause elicitation. Through conducting regression anal-ysis, we identify and interpret 24 rhetorical devices as triggers of audience applauding. We further build models that can rec-ognize applause-evoking sentences and conclude this work with potential implications.

The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable and prevalent, and can be used to produce creative content. The quality of content is influenced by the prompt used, with more specific prompts that incorporate examples generally producing better results. On from this, it could be seen that using instructions written for crowdsourcing tasks (that are specific and include examples to guide workers) could prove effective LLM prompts. To explore this, we used a previous crowdsourcing pipeline that gave examples to people to help them generate a collectively diverse corpus of motivational messages. We then used this same pipeline to generate messages using GPT-4, and compared the collective diversity of messages from: (1) crowd-writers, (2) GPT-4 using the pipeline, and (3 & 4) two baseline GPT-4 prompts. We found that the LLM prompts using the crowdsourcing pipeline caused GPT-4 to produce more diverse messages than the two baseline prompts. We also discuss implications from messages generated by both human writers and LLMs.",3.581310987472534,"Although the provided text does not directly describe the key elements of a motivational speech, we can infer some relevant information from the third passage, which discusses the generation of motivational messages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The study found that using specific prompts that incorporate examples can produce more diverse and effective motivational messages.  To make a motivational speech impactful for a global audience, the following key elements can be considered:  1. **Specificity and clarity**: A clear and specific message is more likely to resonate with the audience. The study on LLMs suggests that using specific prompts with examples can lead to more effective motivational messages. 2. **Diversity and inclusivity**: A motivational speech that acknowledges and appreciates the diversity of the global audience can be more impactful. The study found that using a crowdsourcing pipeline to generate messages resulted in a more diverse set of motivational messages. 3. **Relevance and relatability**: A speech that is relevant to the audience's experiences and concerns can be more motivating. The use of examples and anecdotes can help make the message more relatable. 4. **Emotional resonance**: A motivational speech that evokes emotions can be more impactful. While the text does not directly discuss this, the study on TED Talks (first passage) identifies rhetorical devices that can elicit applause, suggesting that emotional resonance is an important factor.  By incorporating these elements, a motivational speech can be made more impactful for a global audience."

Universal Themes: Focus on themes that transcend cultural boundaries, such as hope, resilience, and the pursuit of excellence. These themes can inspire and motivate people from diverse backgrounds.  2. Storytelling: Use compelling stories to illustrate your points. Stories can help audiences connect emotionally with your message and remember it more effectively.  3. Simplicity: Keep your language simple and clear to ensure your message is easily understood by a wide audience. Avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some listeners.  4. Authenticity: Be genuine and sincere in your delivery. Authenticity can help build trust with your audience and make your message more impactful.  5. Engagement: Encourage audience participation through questions, interactive activities, or calls to action. This can help keep your audience engaged and invested in your message.  6. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes that could offend or alienate your audience.  7. Emotional Appeal: Use emotional appeals to connect with your audience on a deeper level. This can help evoke empathy, sympathy, or other strong emotions that can motivate people to take action.  8. Visual Aids: Use visual aids such as slides, videos, or props to enhance your message and make it more engaging.  9. Pacing: Vary the pace of your speech to keep your audience interested. Use pauses to emphasize important points and allow your audience to absorb your message.  10. Passion: Deliver your speech with passion and enthusiasm. This can help convey the importance of your message and motivate your audience to take action.  11. Relevance: Make sure your message is relevant to your audience. Tailor your speech to address the specific challenges or issues that your audience is facing.  12. Call to Action: End your speech with a clear call to action. This can help motivate your audience to take the steps necessary to achieve their goals.  By incorporating these elements into your speech, you can create a motivational message that resonates with a global audience and inspires them to take action."

6,llama_rag,Generate a detailed introduction for a talk on the importance of diversity.,"Reflecting on the beauty of diversity in our world.

These proceedings accompany the Belle II talk in the Diversity and Inclusion parallel session delivered during ICHEP 2020. This marks the first external presentation by the Belle II Collaboration, in which we present some of our data and self-reported statistics regarding diversity and inclusion. We also present Belle II's current and planned activities to aid and improve diversity and inclusion. We find that there is still a lot to be done to improve the social working environment and population representation within our collaboration and within high energy physics

I'm incredibly honored to be here today, standing before you at ICHEP 2020 to discuss a topic that is not just relevant, but absolutely crucial for the future of science and, indeed, for the world we inhabit: **diversity**.  We often speak of the *beauty* of diversity, and it's a phrase that genuinely resonates. Think for a moment about the breathtaking spectrum of life that graces our planet – the vibrant coral reefs teeming with a kaleidoscope of fish, the towering redwoods reaching for the sky, the intricate patterns of a butterfly's wings. This biological diversity, the sheer variety of life forms, fuels ecosystems, strengthens resilience, and provides the very foundation for our survival. But what about the diversity *within* our own human endeavors?  Today, we're not just discussing the visible manifestations of diversity, the differences we can easily perceive. We're delving into the multifaceted layers that enrich and empower our collective pursuits, particularly within the realm of high-energy physics and the scientific community as a whole. We're talking about the diversity of backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and skills that contribute to a richer, more robust, and ultimately more successful scientific enterprise.  This presentation, reflecting on the work of the Belle II Collaboration, marks a significant step. This is the first time we, as a collaboration, are publicly sharing our data and insights into the composition and working environment within Belle II. We’ll be presenting data, self-reported statistics regarding diversity and inclusion, and outlining both our current initiatives and our future aspirations for a more equitable and inclusive environment.  The truth is, as we'll see, we recognize that the journey towards genuine diversity and inclusion is an ongoing one. It requires constant effort, honest self-reflection, and a commitment to continuous improvement. The data we present will highlight that while we've made strides, there’s still a considerable amount of work to be done to ensure our environment fosters a sense of belonging, and that our population truly reflects the diverse tapestry of the world we seek to understand.  To understand the significance of this work, we need a framework. To that end, we will be discussing **diversity indices**. These are valuable tools that allow us to quantify complex distributions of attributes, providing us with concrete metrics to measure our progress and identify areas for improvement. We will explore the mathematical principles underlying these indices and how they help us understand the concept of *heterogeneity* within a population.  But this isn't just about numbers and formulas. We'll see that the principles of diversity extend far beyond the confines of theoretical calculations. We'll be drawing parallels to diverse fields, including ecology, immunology, and socioeconomics, illustrating the universal importance of diversity in fostering resilience, innovation, and ultimately, success. We'll explore how these concepts apply to sampling populations and how we can extrapolate from a sample to an entire population, and how to account for the challenges of small-sample diversity.  In closing, let us remember that diversity is not merely a matter of ticking boxes or complying with regulations. It is a fundamental driver of progress. It is the engine of creativity, innovation, and discovery. By embracing diversity, we unlock new perspectives, challenge our assumptions, and create a more vibrant, more inclusive, and ultimately, a more successful scientific community"

7,llama_rag,How can a speaker use storytelling to make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience?,"Stories about overcoming personal struggles can effectively illustrate the application of psychological theories in real life, yet they may fail to resonate with individuals' experiences. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to create tailored narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals. Our study, involving 346 young adults across two settings, demonstrates that personalized LLM-enhanced stories were perceived to be better than human-written ones in conveying key takeaways, promoting reflection, and reducing belief in negative thoughts. These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.

Immersive stories for health are 360-degree videos that intend to alter viewer perceptions about behaviors detrimental to health. They have potential to inform public health at scale, however, immersive story design is still in early stages and largely devoid of best practices. This paper presents a focus group study with 147 viewers of an immersive story about binge drinking experienced through VR headsets and mobile phones. The objective of the study is to identify aspects of immersive story design that influence attitudes towards the health issue exhibited, and to understand how health information is consumed in immersive stories. Findings emphasize the need for an immersive story to provide reasoning behind character engagement in the focal health behavior, to show the main character clearly engaging in the behavior, and to enable viewers to experience escalating symptoms of the behavior before the penultimate health consequence. Findings also show how the design of supporting characters can inadvertently distract viewers and lead them to justify the detrimental behavior being exhibited. The paper concludes with design considerations for enabling immersive stories to better inform public perception of health issues.

Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMI), particularly schizophrenia, experience complex and intense emotions frequently. They increasingly turn to vlogging as an authentic medium for emotional disclosure and online support-seeking. While previous research has primarily focused on text-based disclosure, little is known about how people construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences through video blogs. Our study analyzed 401 YouTube videos created by schizophrenia vloggers, revealing that vloggers disclosed their fear, sadness, and joy through verbal narration by explicit expressions or storytelling. Visually, they employed various framing styles, including Anonymous, Talk-to-Camera, and In-the-Moment approaches, along with diverse visual narration techniques. Notably, we uncovered a concerning 'visual appeal disparity' in audience engagement, with visually appealing videos receiving significantly more views, likes, and comments. This study discusses the role of video-sharing platforms in emotional expression and offers design implications for fostering online care-seeking for emotionally vulnerable populations.",6.573174953460693,"## Using Storytelling to Make a Talk on Mental Health More Relatable  To make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience, a speaker can effectively use storytelling.

Here's how a speaker can leverage these ideas to make a talk on mental health more relatable:  **1. Embrace Personalization & Relatability:**  *   **Learn from the AI research:** The first abstract highlights the power of *personalized* stories. A speaker can't generate personalized stories in real-time like an LLM, but they can *acknowledge the diversity* of experiences. They can start by saying, ""I understand that everyone's journey with mental health is unique. What might resonate with one person might not with another."" This establishes empathy and encourages active listening. *   **Use ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" Approach (Metaphorically):** Instead of one linear story, the speaker can offer multiple examples, representing different struggles (anxiety, depression, etc.). They can say, ""Let me tell you about Sarah, who struggled with anxiety..."" and then transition to, ""And then there's David, who faced depression..."" This subtly acknowledges different pathways. *   **""Mirroring"" & Active Listening:** When sharing a story, the speaker can create a space for people to *reflect on their own experiences*. They can ask questions like, ""Have you ever felt a similar sense of isolation?"" or ""How do you think [character's name] was feeling?"" or ""What would *you* have done in that situation?"" This encourages the audience to connect the story to their lives. *   **Contextualize vs. Generic:** Avoid generic advice. Instead of saying ""Just be positive,"" the speaker could weave in a character's struggle with negative self-talk, highlighting specific thought patterns and, more importantly, how the character *began* to overcome them. *   **Integrate Audience Input (If Possible):** If the format allows, consider a Q&A segment at the end, or encourage brief, anonymous sharing of relatable experiences. This reinforces that the audience is a community, not just passive listeners.  **2. Utilize Visual Storytelling Principles (Even Without VR):**  *   **Learn from Immersive Video Research:** The second abstract underscores the importance of *showing* the experience. Though a speaker won't be using VR, they can create vivid mental images. *   **Descriptive Language:** Instead of just saying ""She felt overwhelmed,"" describe her physical symptoms: ""Her heart pounded in her chest, and the room seemed to spin..."" This helps the audience *feel* the character's emotions. *   **Focus on Escalation & Consequences:** If the story is about a problematic behavior, use the principles from the second abstract to show the progression. The speaker could show *the reasoning* behind the behavior (e.g., social anxiety leading to alcohol use), the behavior itself, and the *negative consequences*. *   **Character Development & Supporting Roles:** Be mindful of supporting characters. Are they hindering or helping the main character's journey? Think about how *their* portrayal might influence audience perceptions.  **3. Embrace Authenticity & Vulnerability:**  *   **Learn from Vlogging Research:** The third abstract underscores the importance of authenticity and emotional expression. The speaker should not be afraid to be vulnerable, sharing their own experiences if appropriate, even in a limited way"

This study discusses the role of video-sharing platforms in emotional expression and offers design implications for fostering online care-seeking for emotionally vulnerable populations.",18.43867301940918,"To make a talk on mental health more relatable through storytelling, a speaker can integrate the following evidence-based strategies, drawing from the research insights provided:  ### 1. **Use Personalized, Relatable Narratives**      - **Leverage AI-enhanced storytelling**: Tailor stories to address common but nuanced struggles (e.g., self-doubt, isolation) using LLM-generated narratives that resonate with diverse audience experiences. Highlight how these stories can mirror real-life challenges while offering hope or coping strategies.      - **Balance realism and plausibility**: Avoid overly dramatized or implausible scenarios. Focus on authentic, everyday moments (e.g., ""I felt paralyzed by anxiety before a work meeting"") to maintain credibility.    ### 2. **Showcase Transformation and Application**      - **Illustrate psychological concepts through lived experiences**: For example, pair cognitive-behavioral techniques (e.g., challenging negative thoughts) with a story of someone overcoming a specific hurdle (e.g., social anxiety at a party).      - **Emphasize progression**: Structure stories to show escalating challenges (e.g., early signs of burnout) and actionable steps toward improvement, mirroring the immersive storytelling findings about binge drinking narratives.    ### 3. **Diversify Narrative Formats**      - **Incorporate multimedia**: Reference vlogging techniques (e.g., ""Talk-to-Camera"" framing) to make stories vivid. Describe visual or auditory elements (e.g., ""Her voice shook as she filmed herself mid-panic attack"") to deepen emotional connection.      - **Address the ""visual appeal disparity""**: If using video clips, ensure production quality doesn’t overshadow content—audiences engage more with polished visuals, but authenticity remains key.    ### 4. **Engage the Audience’s Empathy**      - **Humanize characters**: Like the immersive study, clarify why someone struggles (e.g., ""She drank to numb loneliness"") to prevent justification of harmful behaviors and foster understanding.      - **Invite reflection**: Pose questions during the story (""Have you ever felt this way?"") to encourage self-relevance, similar to how personalized LLM stories prompted introspection.    ### 5. **Highlight Community and Support**      - **Share vloggers’ strategies**: Reference how individuals with SMI use platforms like YouTube to seek support, normalizing help-seeking behaviors. For example, ""One vlogger described joy in small wins—like leaving the house—and hundreds commented, ‘Me too.’""    ### 6. **Design Considerations for Delivery**      - **Tone and wording**: Use conversational, non-clinical language (e.g., ""I couldn’t silence the voice saying ‘You’re failing’"" vs. ""I experienced intrusive thoughts"").      - **Pacing**: Build tension gradually (e.g., early symptoms → crisis → recovery) to mirror effective immersive narratives.    ### Example Story Structure:   1. **Hook**: ""Last year, I filmed myself sobbing after canceling plans for the 10th time—I didn’t know it was anxiety.""   2. **Struggle**: Describe specific thoughts (""I’m a bad friend"") and physical symptoms (e.g., shaking hands).   3. **Turning Point**: ""A video comment said, ‘This was me—therapy helped.’""   4. **Takeaway**: ""Challenge the thought:"

Here's a breakdown based on the provided context and broader knowledge:  **1. Automated Detection:**  *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** This is a core technology for identifying hateful content. NLP techniques are used to analyze the text of posts and comments.     *   **Keyword Filtering:** Simple but effective, this method uses lists of known hate speech keywords, slurs, and phrases to flag potentially problematic content.     *   **Sentiment Analysis:** This determines the emotional tone of the text. Hateful content often displays negative sentiment, which can be detected.     *   **Machine Learning (ML) & AI:**         *   **Classification Models:** Trained on massive datasets of labeled text (hate speech, not hate speech), these models can predict the likelihood of a post containing hateful content. As the research indicates that content can differ depending on platform (Reddit and 4chan), the algorithm should be trained on a platform-specific dataset.         *   **Contextual Analysis:** Modern ML models understand the context of words and phrases, enabling them to detect nuanced hate speech (e.g., sarcasm, code words) more effectively.  *   **Image and Video Analysis:** This goes beyond text to analyze visual content.     *   **Object Detection:** Identifies hate symbols (e.g., swastikas), offensive imagery, or logos associated with hate groups.     *   **Facial Recognition:** Can be used (controversially) to identify individuals known to spread hate speech, although this raises privacy concerns.     *   **Audio Analysis:** For videos, analyzing audio to detect slurs, hateful speech, or hate speech tones.  **2. Human Oversight and Moderation:**  *   **Content Review Teams:** Human moderators review flagged content, making final decisions on whether it violates platform policies. This is crucial for handling ambiguous cases and preventing false positives. *   **Community Reporting:** Platforms rely on users to report offensive content. Reporting systems, often including options to specify the type of violation, are vital. *   **Appeals Processes:** Users can appeal moderation decisions, providing an opportunity for human review if they believe their content was unfairly flagged.  **3. Network-Based Strategies:**  *   **Identifying and Monitoring Hateful Actors:** This involves:     *   **User Profiling:** Analyzing user behavior, posting patterns, network connections, and content to identify individuals or groups actively involved in spreading hate speech.     *   **Network Analysis:** Mapping the connections between users to understand how hate speech spreads and identify influential accounts. *   **Deplatforming and Account Suspension:** Removing users who consistently violate platform policies, which disrupts their ability to spread hate. *   **Shadowbanning:** Limiting the visibility of an account without outright banning it, which can reduce its reach and impact. *   **Demoting or Removing Hateful Content:** Taking down posts, comments, or other content that violate policies. *   **Fact-Checking:** Partnering with fact-checking organizations to debunk and label false or misleading information that may contribute to hate speech.  **4. Platform-Specific Considerations:**  *   **Customized Policies:** Platforms tailor their policies to address the specific types"

9,gemini_rag,How can a social media platform encourage user engagement on posts about environmental awareness?,"Social media is now the predominant source of information due to the availability of immediate public response. As a result, social media data has become a valuable resource for comprehending public sentiments. Studies have shown that it can amplify ideas and influence public sentiments. This study analyzes the public perception of climate change and the environment over a decade from 2014 to 2023. Using the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) algorithm, we identify sentiment and explore prevailing emotions expressed within environmental tweets across various social media platforms, namely Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. Accuracy on a human-annotated dataset was 0.65, higher than Vader score but lower than that of an expert rater (0.90). Our findings suggest that negative environmental tweets are far more common than positive or neutral ones. Climate change, air quality, emissions, plastic, and recycling are the most discussed topics on all social media platforms, highlighting its huge global concern. The most common emotions in environmental tweets are fear, trust, and anticipation, demonstrating public reactions wide and complex nature. By identifying patterns and trends in opinions related to the environment, we hope to provide insights that can help raise awareness regarding environmental issues, inform the development of interventions, and adapt further actions to meet environmental challenges.

Social media is very popular for facilitating conversations about important topics and bringing forth insights and issues related to these topics. Reddit serves as a platform that fosters social interactions and hosts engaging discussions on a wide array of topics, thus forming narratives around these topics. One such topic is climate change. There are extensive discussions on Reddit about climate change, indicating high interest in its various aspects. In this paper, we explore 11 subreddits that discuss climate change for the duration of 2014 to 2022 and conduct a data-driven analysis of the posts on these subreddits. We present a basic characterization of the data and show the distribution of the posts and authors across our dataset for all years. Additionally, we analyze user engagement metrics like scores for the posts and how they change over time. We also offer insights into the topics of discussion across the subreddits, followed by entities referenced throughout the dataset

Researchers are developing mobile sensing platforms to facilitate public awareness of environmental conditions. However, turning such awareness into practical community action and political change requires more than just collecting and presenting data. To inform research on mobile environmental sensing, we conducted design fieldwork with government, private, and public interest stakeholders. In parallel, we built an environmental air quality sensing system and deployed it on street sweeping vehicles in a major U.S. city; this served as a ""research vehicle"" by grounding our interviews and affording us status as environmental action researchers. In this paper, we present a qualitative analysis of the landscape of environmental action, focusing on insights that will help researchers frame meaningful technological interventions.",5.5276548862457275,"Based on the provided texts and general understanding of social media, here's how a platform could encourage user engagement on posts about environmental awareness, drawing on the research insights:  **I. Content Strategies to Spark Engagement:**  *   **Highlighting Negative Emotions and Providing Solutions:** Since the research indicates negative sentiments are prevalent, the platform should *not* shy away from showcasing the problems. It's important to acknowledge the negativity (fear, etc.) to create a more emotionally resonant experience. However, the platform should proactively pair these discussions with constructive responses and potential solutions.     *   **Example:** ""Feeling scared about climate change? You're not alone. Here's what you can do [link to actionable steps, local organizations, etc.].""     *   **Actionable Steps:**         *   **Posts with Solutions:** Instead of just highlighting the problem, provide practical advice, how-to guides, DIY projects (e.g., building a compost bin), lists of sustainable products, information on supporting environmental organizations.         *   **Positive Framing:** Even with negative topics, use positive framing where possible. For example, ""How we're reducing emissions in X city"" instead of just ""Emissions are a problem."" *   **Encouraging Diverse Perspectives**     *   **Encourage diverse voices:** Encourage voices from different geographical locations and demographics, so users from different backgrounds can relate to the content     *   **Moderation and fact-checking:** Focus on moderation and fact-checking to verify that information is accurate and up-to-date. *   **Focus on Key Topics:** The research shows that ""Climate change, air quality, emissions, plastic, and recycling"" are significant topics. The platform should actively curate and promote content around these themes.     *   **Create Dedicated Topic Sections/Hashtags:** Establish clear, searchable sections or hashtags for each topic to facilitate focused discussion and make it easier for users to find content they're interested in.     *   **Collaborate with Experts:** Partner with environmental scientists, activists, educators, and organizations to create and share authoritative content.     *   **Run Campaigns:** Organize themed campaigns (e.g., ""Plastic-Free Week"") that include various types of posts, contests, and live events to generate sustained interest. *   **Cater to Emotional Drivers:**     *   **Fear, Trust, Anticipation:** Address these emotions directly. ""Feeling scared? Let's explore what's causing it, and what steps we can take to lessen the risk."" Focus on building trust by partnering with credible sources and showing evidence to back up claims. Use the emotion of anticipation to build up excitement for the future.     *   **Tell Stories:** Humanize the environmental stories. Share personal stories of individuals, local communities, and the positive impact of their actions. Videos, photos, and testimonials are powerful here.     *   **Connect Locally:** Encourage users to discuss environmental issues specific to their region and what local actions they can take.     *   **Visual Content:** Use of imagery, videos, and infographics is vital to capture attention.  **II. Platform Features to Boost Engagement:**  *   **Interactive Elements:**     *   **Polls and Quizzes:** Ask engaging questions related to environmental issues.     *   **Q&A Sessions:** Host live Q&A"

Here are some actionable strategies based on the research findings:  ### **1. Leverage Emotional Triggers**   - **Highlight urgency with fear/anticipation**: Since fear and anticipation are dominant emotions in environmental discussions, frame posts to emphasize actionable solutions (e.g., ""How you can reduce plastic waste today"") rather than doom-and-gloom narratives.   - **Build trust**: Use credible sources (scientists, NGOs) and data visualizations to counter misinformation and foster trust.    ### **2. Optimize Content Around High-Engagement Topics**   Focus on **climate change, air quality, emissions, plastic, and recycling**—the most-discussed topics. Examples:   - **Interactive posts**: ""Which single-use plastic item will you ditch this week? Vote below!""   - **Localized content**: ""How’s the air quality in your city today? Check our real-time map.""    ### **3. Boost Engagement Through Community Interaction**   - **Encourage discussions**: Ask open-ended questions (e.g., ""What’s one change your community made to fight climate change?"").   - **Host AMAs (Ask Me Anything)**: Partner with environmental scientists or activists on Reddit/Twitter.   - **Gamification**: Reward users for sharing eco-friendly habits (e.g., badges for recycling pledges).    ### **4. Use Data-Driven Storytelling**   - **Visualize trends**: Share infographics on decade-long sentiment shifts (e.g., ""How Twitter feels about climate change"").   - **User-generated content**: Encourage sharing personal stories (e.g., ""Post a photo of your reusable grocery bag"").    ### **5. Platform-Specific Strategies**   - **Twitter**: Short, impactful stats + hashtag campaigns (#PlasticFreeJuly).   - **Reddit**: Deep-dive discussions in subreddits (e.g., r/environment or r/sustainability).   - **YouTube**: Mini-documentaries or influencer collaborations (e.g., ""A day without plastic"").    ### **6. Partner with Stakeholders**   - **Government/NGO collaborations**: Amplify policy changes or community initiatives.   - **Citizen science**: Integrate mobile sensing data (e.g., air quality maps) into posts for real-time engagement.    ### **7. Mitigate Negativity Bias**   Since negative sentiments dominate, balance with **hopeful, solution-oriented content** (e.g., ""5 cities that cut emissions by 50%"").    ### **Key Takeaway**   Align content with **emotional triggers, trending topics, and interactive formats** while fostering trust and community action. By combining data insights with participatory design, platforms can turn awareness into measurable engagement.
