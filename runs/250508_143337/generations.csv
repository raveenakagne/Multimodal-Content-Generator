Make It Relatable & Shareable**   - **Emotion-driven content**: Humor, nostalgia, or inspiration spreads faster.   - **User-generated content (UGC)**: Encourage followers to recreate your trend (e.g., #InMyDenim, #FlipTheSwitch).   - **Short & engaging**: Keep videos under 15–30 seconds for maximum retention.    ### **3. Optimize for Instagram’s Algorithm**   - **Post at peak times**: Use Instagram Insights to find when your audience is most active.   - **Use trending audio**: Viral Reels often rely on trending sounds.   - **Engage quickly**: Reply to comments and DMs within the first hour to boost reach.    ### **4. Collaborate & Cross-Promote**   - **Partner with influencers**: Micro-influencers (10K–100K followers) often have highly engaged audiences.   - **Cross-platform sharing**: Promote your trend on TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube Shorts.    ### **5. Use Strategic Hashtags & Captions**   - **Mix trending & niche hashtags** (e.g., #Viral, #Trending + your unique hashtag).   - **Engaging captions**: Ask questions or use CTAs like ""Tag a friend who needs to see this!""    ### **6. Keep It Simple & Repeatable**   - The easier it is to participate, the more likely it will spread (e.g., #10YearChallenge).   - Use **templates** (e.g., ""POV"" or ""This vs. That"" formats).    ### **7. Ride on Pop Culture & Memes**   - Tie your trend to current events, memes, or viral moments (e.g., #WAPChallenge, #SavageChallenge).    ### **8. Consistency & Experimentation**   - Post frequently (3–5 Reels/week) and test different formats.   - Analyze performance and refine your approach.    ### **9. Paid Boost (Optional)**   - Run a small ad campaign to seed the trend before organic growth kicks in.    ### **Examples of Successful Instagram Trends:**   - **#DontRushChallenge** (users transformed outfits in a quick transition)   - **#BussItChallenge** (outfit reveal trend)   - **#SilhouetteChallenge** (viral filter + music trend)    Would you like help brainstorming a specific trend idea for your niche? 🚀"

As we gather here today, we are part of a global community that is more interconnected than ever before. We live in a world where people from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities are increasingly coming together to work, learn, and innovate. And yet, despite this growing interconnectedness, we still see too many examples of division, inequality, and exclusion.  In many areas of our lives - from education to employment, from politics to popular culture - we are still grappling with the challenges of creating inclusive environments that value and celebrate diversity. We see the impact of a lack of diversity in the homogeneity of our workplaces, the narrowness of our perspectives, and the limitations of our creativity. We see it in the disparities in health outcomes, educational attainment, and economic opportunities that persist across different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.  But diversity is not just a moral imperative or a social justice issue - it's also a business imperative and a driver of innovation. Research has shown that diverse teams are more creative, more productive, and more effective at solving complex problems. Companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion are more likely to attract top talent, drive business growth, and build strong relationships with customers and stakeholders.

Here's how a speaker can use it effectively:  **1.  Share Personal Experiences (If Comfortable):**  *   **Authenticity is Key:**  The most impactful stories often come from personal experiences.  If you're comfortable, sharing your own struggles, recovery journey, or insights can create an instant connection.  It humanizes the topic and shows vulnerability. *   **Control & Boundaries:**  You don't have to share everything.  Be mindful of your comfort level. You can focus on specific aspects, the emotional impact, or lessons learned. *   **Focus on Emotional Truth:** Even if you don't share specific details, you can convey the feelings (anxiety, depression, isolation, hope) that accompany mental health challenges.  **2.  Use the Stories of Others (with Permission and Respect):**  *   **Anonymized or Fictionalized Cases:**  Protect privacy by using anonymized or fictionalized (but realistic) case studies.  This is a safe way to illustrate different experiences. *   **Focus on Universal Themes:**  Highlight common experiences like feeling overwhelmed, struggling with self-doubt, seeking help, or finding coping mechanisms. *   **Permission and Consent:**  Always get permission to share someone's story, especially if you're using specifics or identifying information (even if anonymized). *   **Empathy and Sensitivity:**  Approach the stories with empathy, avoiding judgment or sensationalism.  Focus on the individual's experience and their journey.  **3.  Craft a Compelling Narrative Structure:**  *   **The Setup:**  Introduce the character(s) and their situation. What's their life like before the challenge? *   **The Inciting Incident:**  What event triggers the mental health issue or makes it more apparent? This could be a major life change, a stressful event, or a gradual decline. *   **The Struggle/Rising Action:**  Describe the challenges the character faces.  How does their mental health affect their daily life, relationships, and goals? *   **The Turning Point:**  What causes the character to realize they need help?  This could be hitting rock bottom, a conversation with a loved one, or a significant event. *   **The Climax:**  The character takes a significant action related to seeking help or making a change (e.g., seeking therapy, confiding in someone). *   **The Resolution/Falling Action:**  What happens after the turning point?  What's the recovery process like? What are the challenges and triumphs? *   **The Conclusion/Lesson:**  What's the takeaway for the audience?  What are the key messages about mental health, help-seeking, and resilience?  **4.  Use Sensory Details and Vivid Language:**  *   **Show, Don't Tell:** Instead of saying ""They were anxious,"" describe how their anxiety manifested: ""His palms were constantly sweating, and he felt a knot in his stomach before every meeting."" *   **Engage the Senses:** Use descriptions that appeal to sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch to create a more immersive experience for the audience. *   **Emotional Vocabulary:** Use words that evoke feelings and create a deeper"

3,llama_rag,What are the best practices for creating a viral trend on Instagram?,"Social media generates a prodigious wealth of real-time content at an incessant rate. From all the content that people create and share, only a few topics manage to attract enough attention to rise to the top and become temporal trends which are displayed to users. The question of what factors cause the formation and persistence of trends is an important one that has not been answered yet. In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending topics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation, persistence and decay of trends. We also demonstrate empirically how factors such as user activity and number of followers do not contribute strongly to trend creation and its propagation. In fact, we find that the resonance of the content with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing trends.

In addition to more personalized content feeds, some leading social media platforms give a prominent role to content that is more widely popular. On Twitter, ""trending topics"" identify popular topics of conversation on the platform, thereby promoting popular content which users might not have otherwise seen through their network. Hence, ""trending topics"" potentially play important roles in influencing the topics users engage with on a particular day. Using two carefully constructed data sets from India and Turkey, we study the effects of a hashtag appearing on the trending topics page on the number of tweets produced with that hashtag. We specifically aim to answer the question: How many new tweeting using that hashtag appear because a hashtag is labeled as trending? We distinguish the effects of the trending topics page from network exposure and find there is a statistically significant, but modest, return to a hashtag being featured on trending topics. Analysis of the types of users impacted by trending topics shows that the feature helps less popular and new users to discover and spread content outside their network, which they otherwise might not have been able to do.

Searching for influential spreaders in complex networks is an issue of great significance for applications across various domains, ranging from the epidemic control, innovation diffusion, viral marketing, social movement to idea propagation. In this paper, we first display some of the most important theoretical models that describe spreading processes, and then discuss the problem of locating both the individual and multiple influential spreaders respectively. Recent approaches in these two topics are presented. For the identification of privileged single spreaders, we summarize several widely used centralities, such as degree, betweenness centrality, PageRank, k-shell, etc. We investigate the empirical diffusion data in a large scale online social community -- LiveJournal. With this extensive dataset, we find that various measures can convey very distinct information of nodes. Of all the users in LiveJournal social network, only a small fraction of them involve in spreading. For the spreading processes in LiveJournal, while degree can locate nodes participating in information diffusion with higher probability, k-shell is more effective in finding nodes with large influence. Our results should provide useful information for designing efficient spreading strategies in reality.",6.198451042175293,"## Step 1: Understand the context of creating a viral trend on Instagram To create a viral trend on Instagram, we need to understand the factors that contribute to the formation and persistence of trends on social media platforms. The given text provides insights into the factors that cause trends on Twitter, which can be applied to Instagram as well.  ## Step 2: Identify key factors that contribute to creating a viral trend The text highlights that the resonance of the content with the users plays a major role in causing trends. It also mentions that user activity and the number of followers do not strongly contribute to trend creation and its propagation.  ## Step 3: Analyze the role of content resonance and other factors Content resonance is crucial as it determines how well the content is received by the users. Other factors such as being featured on a ""trending topics"" page can also give a modest boost to the content's visibility.  ## Step 4: Consider the impact of being featured on a prominent page Being featured on a prominent page, like the ""trending topics"" page on Twitter, can help less popular and new users discover and spread content outside their network. Although the text specifically talks about Twitter, a similar effect can be expected on Instagram if content is featured prominently, such as on the ""Explore"" page.  ## Step 5: Apply the insights to Instagram For Instagram, creating content that resonates with a wide audience is key. This can involve using popular hashtags, creating engaging and relevant content, and encouraging user interaction.  ## Step 6: Summarize best practices based on the insights Best practices for creating a viral trend on Instagram include: 1. Creating content that resonates with a wide audience. 2. Using relevant and popular hashtags to increase discoverability. 3. Encouraging engagement through likes, comments, and shares. 4. Posting content at optimal times to reach a larger audience. 5. Utilizing Instagram's features such as Stories, Reels, and IGTV to diversify content.  ## Step 7: Consider the role of influencers and user networks While the number of followers may not be a strong predictor of trend creation, influencers and users with a large network can still play a significant role in spreading content. Identifying and collaborating with influencers or creating content that appeals to a broad audience can be beneficial.  The final answer is:  To create a viral trend on Instagram, focus on creating content that resonates with a wide audience, use relevant and popular hashtags, encourage engagement, post at optimal times, and utilize various Instagram features.

Here are the best practices based on research and successful trends:  ### **1. Content Resonance is Key**   - **Emotional Appeal**: Content that evokes strong emotions (humor, awe, inspiration, outrage) spreads faster.   - **Relatability**: Trends often tap into shared experiences or cultural moments (e.g., challenges, memes).   - **Novelty**: Unique, unexpected, or visually striking content stands out.    ### **2. Leverage Hashtags & Trends**   - **Use Trending Hashtags**: Monitor Instagram’s ""Explore"" and ""Trending"" sections to join viral conversations.   - **Create a Branded Hashtag**: Short, catchy, and easy to remember (e.g., #IceBucketChallenge).   - **Encourage User Participation**: Challenges, duets, or templates (e.g., Reels trends) boost engagement.    ### **3. Optimize for Instagram’s Algorithm**   - **Post at Peak Times**: Use Instagram Insights to find when your audience is most active.   - **Prioritize Reels & Short Videos**: Instagram favors Reels, especially those under 15 seconds.   - **Engagement Bait (Ethically)**: Ask questions, use polls, or encourage shares (but avoid spammy tactics).    ### **4. Network Effects & Influencer Collaboration**   - **Partner with Micro-Influencers**: They often have higher engagement rates than mega-influencers.   - **Cross-Promote on Other Platforms**: Share Instagram content on TikTok, Twitter, or YouTube for wider reach.   - **Encourage Shares & Tags**: Viral trends often rely on users tagging friends (e.g., ""Tag someone who…"").    ### **5. Timing & Momentum**   - **Ride Current Events**: Tie content to holidays, pop culture, or breaking news (but stay authentic).   - **Consistency**: Posting frequently keeps your content in the algorithm’s favor.   - **Early Adoption**: Jump on emerging trends before they peak.    ### **6. Analyze & Adapt**   - **Track Performance**: Use Instagram Insights to see what works (likes, shares, saves).   - **A/B Test Content**: Experiment with different formats (carousels, Stories, Reels).   - **Learn from Viral Posts**: Study competitors or viral accounts in your niche.    ### **Key Takeaways from Research**   - **User Activity ≠ Virality**: Even less popular users can start trends if content resonates.   - **Network Exposure Helps**: Being featured on ""Trending"" boosts visibility but isn’t the sole driver.   - **K-Shell & Influence**: In networks, users with high ""k-shell"" (core influence) spread trends more effectively.    By combining these strategies, you can increase the chances of creating or capitalizing on a viral Instagram trend.

5,llama_rag,Describe the key elements that make a motivational speech impactful for a global audience.,"One problem that every presenter faces when delivering a public discourse is how to hold the listeners' attentions or to keep them involved. Therefore, many studies in conversation analysis work on this issue and suggest qualitatively con-structions that can effectively lead to audience's applause. To investigate these proposals quantitatively, in this study we an-alyze the transcripts of 2,135 TED Talks, with a particular fo-cus on the rhetorical devices that are used by the presenters for applause elicitation. Through conducting regression anal-ysis, we identify and interpret 24 rhetorical devices as triggers of audience applauding. We further build models that can rec-ognize applause-evoking sentences and conclude this work with potential implications.

The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable and prevalent, and can be used to produce creative content. The quality of content is influenced by the prompt used, with more specific prompts that incorporate examples generally producing better results. On from this, it could be seen that using instructions written for crowdsourcing tasks (that are specific and include examples to guide workers) could prove effective LLM prompts. To explore this, we used a previous crowdsourcing pipeline that gave examples to people to help them generate a collectively diverse corpus of motivational messages. We then used this same pipeline to generate messages using GPT-4, and compared the collective diversity of messages from: (1) crowd-writers, (2) GPT-4 using the pipeline, and (3 & 4) two baseline GPT-4 prompts. We found that the LLM prompts using the crowdsourcing pipeline caused GPT-4 to produce more diverse messages than the two baseline prompts. We also discuss implications from messages generated by both human writers and LLMs.",4.325958967208862,"Although the provided text does not directly describe the key elements of a motivational speech, we can infer some relevant information from the third passage, which discusses the generation of motivational messages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The study found that using specific prompts that incorporate examples can produce more diverse and effective motivational messages.  To make a motivational speech impactful for a global audience, the following key elements can be considered:  1. **Specificity and clarity**: A clear and specific message is more likely to resonate with the audience. The study on LLMs suggests that using specific prompts with examples can lead to more effective motivational messages. 2. **Diversity and inclusivity**: A motivational speech that acknowledges and appreciates the diversity of the global audience can be more impactful. The study found that using a crowdsourcing pipeline to generate messages resulted in a more diverse set of motivational messages. 3. **Relevance and relatability**: A speech that is relevant to the audience's experiences and concerns can be more motivating. The use of examples and anecdotes can help make the message more relatable. 4. **Emotional resonance**: A motivational speech that evokes emotions can be more impactful. While the text does not directly discuss this, the study on TED Talks (first passage) identifies rhetorical devices that can elicit applause, suggesting that emotional resonance is an important factor.  By incorporating these elements, a motivational speech can be made more impactful for a global audience."

Universal Themes: Focus on themes that transcend cultural boundaries, such as hope, resilience, and the pursuit of excellence. These themes can inspire and motivate people from diverse backgrounds.  2. Storytelling: Use compelling stories to illustrate your points. Stories can help audiences connect emotionally with your message and remember it more effectively.  3. Simplicity: Keep your language simple and clear to ensure your message is easily understood by a wide audience. Avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some listeners.  4. Authenticity: Be genuine and sincere in your delivery. Authenticity can help build trust with your audience and make your message more impactful.  5. Engagement: Encourage audience participation through questions, interactive activities, or calls to action. This can help keep your audience engaged and invested in your message.  6. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes that could offend or alienate your audience.  7. Emotional Appeal: Use emotional appeals to connect with your audience on a deeper level. This can help evoke empathy, sympathy, or other strong emotions that can motivate people to take action.  8. Visual Aids: Use visual aids such as slides, videos, or props to enhance your message and make it more engaging.  9. Pacing: Vary the pace of your speech to keep your audience interested. Use pauses to emphasize important points and allow your audience to absorb your message.  10. Passion: Deliver your speech with passion and enthusiasm. This can help convey the importance of your message and motivate your audience to take action.  11. Relevance: Make sure your message is relevant to your audience. Tailor your speech to address the specific challenges or issues that your audience is facing.  12. Call to Action: End your speech with a clear call to action. This can help motivate your audience to take the steps necessary to achieve their goals.  By incorporating these elements into your speech, you can create a motivational message that resonates with a global audience and inspires them to take action."

Avoid focusing solely on culturally specific issues that might not resonate globally. *   **Highlighting Common Goals:** A global audience shares aspirations like peace, progress, and well-being. Focus on these common desires to create a sense of unity and shared purpose.  **2. Engaging and Inclusive Language:**  *   **Simple and Clear Language:** Avoid complex jargon or overly academic language that can be difficult for non-native speakers to understand. Keep sentences concise and to the point. *   **Figurative Language and Storytelling:** Utilize powerful metaphors, analogies, and storytelling. These help to make abstract concepts relatable and memorable. Stories can cross cultural boundaries more easily than abstract arguments. *   **Inclusive Pronouns and Examples:** Use ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our"" to foster a sense of community. Use diverse examples that represent people from various backgrounds and experiences. *   **Translation Considerations:** If the speech is intended for widespread consumption, consider translation and/or providing transcripts in multiple languages.  **3. Strong Delivery and Rhetorical Techniques (as seen in the TED Talk analysis):**  *   **Appealing to Emotions (Pathos):** Motivational speeches are built on emotional connections. The speaker must be able to evoke feelings of inspiration, excitement, empathy, and hope. *   **Building Credibility (Ethos):** Demonstrate expertise, sincerity, and a genuine belief in the message. Share personal experiences and vulnerabilities to make the speaker more relatable. *   **Logical Reasoning (Logos):** Provide a clear structure and well-supported arguments. Present data, facts, and evidence to back up claims. *   **Applause Elicitation:** The research suggests that certain rhetorical devices are effective in getting an audience involved. These may include:     *   **Rhetorical Questions:** Engaging the audience to think about the topic.     *   **Positive Reinforcement:** Phrases of support and encouragement.     *   **Storytelling:** Sharing memorable and relatable experiences.     *   **Summarization of Key Points:** Providing highlights of the presentation. *   **Dynamic Vocal Delivery:** Varying the pace, tone, and volume of the voice to keep the audience engaged. *   **Non-Verbal Communication:** Use body language, gestures, and facial expressions to convey confidence, enthusiasm, and connection.  **4. Relevance and Timeliness:**  *   **Addressing Current Issues:** Connect the motivational message to current events, challenges, or opportunities that resonate with a global audience. *   **Offering Actionable Insights:** Provide practical steps, strategies, or tools that the audience can use to implement the message in their own lives.  **5. The Power of AI and Conversational Interfaces (and their societal implications)**  *   **Adaptation in speech:** Be aware of how individuals adapt their speech patterns. *   **Societal impact:** Recognise the potential for AI to affect a brand's perception and social identity. *   **Interdisciplinary research:** Further"

Rhetorical Devices for Engagement**   - **Repetition & Parallelism** (e.g., ""I have a dream…"") reinforces key messages.   - **Contrast & Antithesis** (""Not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it"") creates dramatic impact.   - **Rhetorical Questions** prompt reflection and involvement.   - **Triadic Structures** (""Mind, body, and spirit"") enhance memorability.    *(As seen in the TED Talks study, 24 rhetorical devices were found to trigger applause, suggesting structured phrasing enhances audience response.)*    ### **3.

7,llama_rag,How can a speaker use storytelling to make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience?,"Stories about overcoming personal struggles can effectively illustrate the application of psychological theories in real life, yet they may fail to resonate with individuals' experiences. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to create tailored narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals. Our study, involving 346 young adults across two settings, demonstrates that personalized LLM-enhanced stories were perceived to be better than human-written ones in conveying key takeaways, promoting reflection, and reducing belief in negative thoughts. These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.

Immersive stories for health are 360-degree videos that intend to alter viewer perceptions about behaviors detrimental to health. They have potential to inform public health at scale, however, immersive story design is still in early stages and largely devoid of best practices. This paper presents a focus group study with 147 viewers of an immersive story about binge drinking experienced through VR headsets and mobile phones. The objective of the study is to identify aspects of immersive story design that influence attitudes towards the health issue exhibited, and to understand how health information is consumed in immersive stories. Findings emphasize the need for an immersive story to provide reasoning behind character engagement in the focal health behavior, to show the main character clearly engaging in the behavior, and to enable viewers to experience escalating symptoms of the behavior before the penultimate health consequence. Findings also show how the design of supporting characters can inadvertently distract viewers and lead them to justify the detrimental behavior being exhibited. The paper concludes with design considerations for enabling immersive stories to better inform public perception of health issues.

Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMI), particularly schizophrenia, experience complex and intense emotions frequently. They increasingly turn to vlogging as an authentic medium for emotional disclosure and online support-seeking. While previous research has primarily focused on text-based disclosure, little is known about how people construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences through video blogs. Our study analyzed 401 YouTube videos created by schizophrenia vloggers, revealing that vloggers disclosed their fear, sadness, and joy through verbal narration by explicit expressions or storytelling. Visually, they employed various framing styles, including Anonymous, Talk-to-Camera, and In-the-Moment approaches, along with diverse visual narration techniques. Notably, we uncovered a concerning 'visual appeal disparity' in audience engagement, with visually appealing videos receiving significantly more views, likes, and comments. This study discusses the role of video-sharing platforms in emotional expression and offers design implications for fostering online care-seeking for emotionally vulnerable populations.",6.656111240386963,"## Using Storytelling to Make a Talk on Mental Health More Relatable  To make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience, a speaker can effectively use storytelling.

Focus on Personal Connection and Relatability (Leveraging the First Study):**  *   **Acknowledge Diverse Experiences:**  Instead of assuming a single ""right"" experience, recognize that people's struggles and thoughts are unique. You can start by saying something like, ""We all experience challenges with our mental health differently."" *   **Share *Specific* and *Relatable* Stories:**  Draw from the findings that LLM-enhanced stories were found to be more relatable. This doesn't mean you have to use AI to write *your* stories (unless you want to!), but it suggests that crafting narratives that acknowledge nuances is key.     *   **Emphasize everyday situations:** Steer clear of overly dramatic or exceptional circumstances unless they're used to illustrate a specific point. Focus on the common anxieties, stressors, and thoughts that your audience is likely to face.     *   **Use ""I"" statements:**  Sharing your own experience, or that of someone close to you (with permission, of course), is critical. Frame it in a way that shows you have the vulnerability to deal with the tough challenges.     *   **Illustrate thought patterns:** Instead of just *telling* the audience that negative thoughts are harmful, *show* it through a story where the character:         *   Is experiencing a specific emotion (e.g., anxiety about a social event).         *   Has negative thoughts (e.g., ""I'll embarrass myself."").         *   Has a trigger for the thought (e.g., reading social media or thinking about the event).         *   Has strategies they use to manage the thoughts (e.g., challenging the thought, changing their perception, practicing relaxation techniques).     *   **Use diverse characters:** If using fictional stories, create characters with various challenges, backgrounds, and coping mechanisms. This allows more people to find a character who resonates with them. *   **Highlight the *Process* of Management:** Rather than just a success story, focus on the journey. Show the character struggling, stumbling, and learning.  This makes the story more authentic and relatable because the journey is often harder than people perceive. *   **Avoid Overtly Negative Content:** While mental health often deals with the difficulties, show that the character, or you, are going to make a shift. You could also provide the character with some strategies to feel better.  **2. Design for Engagement and Clarity (Lessons from the Second Study):**  *   **Provide Context and Motivation:**  If your story involves a character facing a mental health challenge, show *why* they're in that situation. What's driving their behavior or mindset? Show the reasoning. *   **Gradual Escalation (For Serious Discussions):** When addressing a challenging topic, like the impact of substance abuse on mental health (if relevant to your talk), avoid jumping to the extremes. Show the early signs, the gradual worsening of symptoms, and the consequences. *   **Avoid Distractions:** If your story involves a supporting character, ensure they don't overshadow the main message or inadvertently undermine the core message. They should enhance, not detract from, the central experience"

While previous research has primarily focused on text-based disclosure, little is known about how people construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences through video blogs. Our study analyzed 401 YouTube videos created by schizophrenia vloggers, revealing that vloggers disclosed their fear, sadness, and joy through verbal narration by explicit expressions or storytelling. Visually, they employed various framing styles, including Anonymous, Talk-to-Camera, and In-the-Moment approaches, along with diverse visual narration techniques. Notably, we uncovered a concerning 'visual appeal disparity' in audience engagement, with visually appealing videos receiving significantly more views, likes, and comments. This study discusses the role of video-sharing platforms in emotional expression and offers design implications for fostering online care-seeking for emotionally vulnerable populations.",34.382936000823975,"To make a talk on mental health more relatable using storytelling, a speaker can leverage the insights from the studies you’ve shared. Here’s a structured approach:  ### **1. Use Personalized, Relatable Stories**   - **Tailor narratives to the audience**: Just as LLMs were used to create personalized stories, a speaker can craft or select anecdotes that reflect common struggles (e.g., anxiety, self-doubt) while acknowledging individual differences.   - **Balance realism and hope**: Avoid overly dramatized or implausible endings—stories should feel authentic yet constructive.    ### **2. Incorporate Psychological Theories in an Accessible Way**   - **Show, don’t just tell**: Instead of explaining cognitive distortions abstractly, use a story where a character recognizes and challenges a negative thought (e.g., ""I’m a failure"" → ""I’m learning"").   - **Highlight transformation**: Emphasize how small, actionable steps (e.g., journaling, seeking support) led to change.    ### **3. Leverage Multi-Sensory Storytelling (If Possible)**   - **For digital/virtual talks**: Borrow from immersive health storytelling by using:     - **First-person perspectives** (""This is what a panic attack feels like…"").     - **Gradual escalation** (e.g., depicting how unchecked stress leads to burnout).     - **Clear cause-and-effect** (e.g., ""Here’s why the character avoided help—and what happened when they finally reached out"").    ### **4. Address Audience Emotions Visually and Verbally**   - **Use video clips or images**: If presenting digitally, integrate short vlog-style clips (like those from schizophrenia vloggers) to humanize struggles.     - **Talk-to-camera** moments build intimacy.     - **Anonymous/In-the-Moment** techniques can depict raw emotions without exposing identities.   - **Avoid ""visual appeal bias""**: If sharing others’ stories, ensure diverse representations (not just polished, high-production content).    ### **5. Design for Reflection and Engagement**   - **Pause for audience reflection**: After a story, ask, ""Has anyone felt this way?"" or ""What would you do differently?""   - **Use relatable characters**: Like the binge-drinking study, show *why* someone struggles (e.g., ""She drank to cope with loneliness"") to foster empathy, not judgment.    ### **6. Balance Authenticity and Hope**   - **Avoid toxic positivity**: Acknowledge that recovery isn’t linear.   - **Show ""messy"" progress**: Stories where setbacks lead to growth resonate more than flawless victories.    ### **Key Takeaways for Speakers**   - **Personalization > Generalization**: Adapt stories to your audience’s demographics (e.g., students, professionals).   - **Show vulnerability**: Sharing your own struggles (if appropriate) boosts authenticity.   - **Interactive elements**: Polls, Q&A, or guided reflections deepen engagement.    By blending these strategies, a speaker can make mental health discussions more relatable, memorable, and actionable.    Would you like help brainstorming specific story frameworks for a particular audience (e.g., teens, corporate settings)?"

The prevalence of online hate speech has fueled horrific real-world hate-crime such as the mass-genocide of Rohingya Muslims, communal violence in Colombo and the recent massacre in the Pittsburgh synagogue. Consequently, It is imperative to understand the diffusion of such hateful content in an online setting. We conduct the first study that analyses the flow and dynamics of posts generated by hateful and non-hateful users on Gab (gab.com) over a massive dataset of 341K users and 21M posts. Our observations confirms that hateful content diffuse farther, wider and faster and have a greater outreach than those of non-hateful users. A deeper inspection into the profiles and network of hateful and non-hateful users reveals that the former are more influential, popular and cohesive. Thus, our research explores the interesting facets of diffusion dynamics of hateful users and broadens our understanding of hate speech in the online world.

Communication on social media platforms is not only culturally and politically relevant, it is also increasingly widespread across societies. Users not only communicate via social media platforms, but also search specifically for information, disseminate it or post information themselves. However, fake news, hate speech and even radicalizing elements are part of this modern form of communication: Sometimes with far-reaching effects on individuals and societies. A basic understanding of these mechanisms and communication patterns could help to counteract negative forms of communication, e.g. bullying among children or extreme political points of view. To this end, a method will be presented in order to break down the underlying communication patterns, to trace individual users and to inspect their comments and range on social media platforms; Or to contrast them later on via qualitative research. This approeach can identify particularly active users with an accuracy of 100 percent, if the framing social networks as well as the topics are taken into account. However, methodological as well as counteracting approaches must be even more dynamic and flexible to ensure sensitivity and specifity regarding users who spread hate speech, fake news and radicalizing elements.

Below are key strategies based on research and industry practices:  ### **1. Automated Detection Using AI & NLP**   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models:**     - Platforms use **machine learning classifiers** trained on labeled datasets to detect hate speech, slurs, and coded language (e.g., dog whistles).     - **Contextual analysis** (e.g., sarcasm, reclaimed slurs) improves accuracy.   - **Cross-Platform Analysis:**     - Since hate spreads across multiple platforms (e.g., Gab, 4chan, Reddit), **cross-platform detection** helps track coordinated hate campaigns.   - **Behavioral Signals:**     - Hateful users often exhibit **higher engagement, faster diffusion, and cohesive networks** (as seen in Gab).     - **Network analysis** can identify influential hate spreaders (e.g., high centrality in retweet networks).    ### **2. Human Moderation & Crowdsourcing**   - **Human Review Teams:**     - AI flags content, but human moderators make final decisions on ambiguous cases.   - **User Reporting:**     - Encouraging users to report hate speech improves detection (though it can be abused).   - **Trust & Safety Teams:**     - Specialized teams monitor extremist communities and enforce policies.    ### **3. Policy & Enforcement Strategies**   - **Clear Hate Speech Policies:**     - Platforms must define hate speech explicitly (e.g., racial slurs, dehumanization).   - **Shadow Banning & Downranking:**     - Limiting the reach of hateful users without outright banning them reduces virality.   - **Account Suspensions & Deplatforming:**     - Removing influential hate spreaders disrupts networks (e.g., banning extremist figures).   - **Algorithmic Adjustments:**     - Reducing algorithmic amplification of divisive content (e.g., Facebook’s ""meaningful social interactions"" shift).    ### **4. Network & Diffusion Control**   - **Graph-Based Detection:**     - Analyzing **user networks** helps identify hate clusters (e.g., Gab’s tightly-knit hate communities).   - **Limiting Virality:**     - Slowing resharing of flagged content (e.g., Twitter’s ""read before retweet"" prompts).   - **Breaking Echo Chambers:**     - Recommending counter-speech or fact-checking to disrupt extremist bubbles.    ### **5. Counter-Speech & Education**   - **Promoting Positive Content:**     - Highlighting counterspeech from activists and marginalized groups.   - **Media Literacy Programs:**     - Educating users on recognizing hate speech and manipulation tactics.    ### **Challenges & Future Directions**   - **Evolving Language:** Hate speech adapts (e.g., memes, coded terms).   - **False Positives/Negatives:** Over-censorship vs. under-detection.   - **Global & Cultural Nuances:** Hate speech definitions vary by region.   - **Decentralized Platforms:** Gab, Telegram, and 4chan evade traditional moderation.    ### **Conclusion**   A **multi-layered approach**—combining AI, human review, network analysis, and policy enforcement—is"

In this paper, we present a qualitative analysis of the landscape of environmental action, focusing on insights that will help researchers frame meaningful technological interventions.",6.81744384765625,"To encourage user engagement on posts about environmental awareness on a social media platform, several strategies can be employed based on the insights from the studies on public perception of climate change and environmental issues:  1. **Use of Emotional Triggers**: The studies indicate that emotions such as fear, trust, and anticipation are commonly associated with environmental tweets. Crafting posts that evoke these emotions can encourage engagement. For instance, highlighting the urgent need for action (fear/anticipation) or showcasing successful environmental initiatives (trust) can stimulate user interaction.  2. **Discussing Relevant Topics**: The research highlights that topics like climate change, air quality, emissions, plastic, and recycling are widely discussed. Focusing on these topics and presenting them in an engaging manner (e.g., through infographics, personal stories, or impactful images) can attract more engagement.  3. **Fostering Community Discussions**: Platforms like Reddit have shown that extensive discussions around climate change can foster a community around the topic. Creating or participating in online forums or groups dedicated to environmental issues can encourage user engagement through comments, shares, and the creation of content.  4. **Utilizing Data and Research**: The studies demonstrate the value of data-driven insights in understanding public sentiments and behaviors. Using data to inform and support environmental posts (e.g., statistics on pollution reduction due to certain practices) can make the content more compelling and shareable.  5. **Interactive Content**: Developing interactive content such as quizzes, polls, or challenges related to environmental awareness can increase user engagement. For example, a ""reduce your carbon footprint"" challenge could encourage users to share their experiences and tips.  6. **Collaborating with Influencers and Stakeholders**: Partnering with influencers or stakeholders in the environmental sector can help amplify the reach and credibility of environmental awareness posts. Their involvement can attract their followers and encourage engagement.  7. **Analyzing and Adapting**: Continuously analyzing user engagement metrics (like scores for posts and how they change over time) and adapting the content strategy based on these insights can help in identifying what works best for the audience.  8. **Mobile Sensing and Community Action**: Integrating insights from mobile environmental sensing and highlighting community actions or changes can inspire users to engage more actively with environmental issues. Showcasing practical actions and their impacts can motivate users.  By implementing these strategies, a social media platform can enhance user engagement on posts related to environmental awareness, contributing to a more informed and active community on environmental issues."

As a result, social media data has become a valuable resource for comprehending public sentiments. Studies have shown that it can amplify ideas and influence public sentiments. This study analyzes the public perception of climate change and the environment over a decade from 2014 to 2023. Using the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) algorithm, we identify sentiment and explore prevailing emotions expressed within environmental tweets across various social media platforms, namely Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. Accuracy on a human-annotated dataset was 0.65, higher than Vader score but lower than that of an expert rater (0.90). Our findings suggest that negative environmental tweets are far more common than positive or neutral ones. Climate change, air quality, emissions, plastic, and recycling are the most discussed topics on all social media platforms, highlighting its huge global concern. The most common emotions in environmental tweets are fear, trust, and anticipation, demonstrating public reactions wide and complex nature. By identifying patterns and trends in opinions related to the environment, we hope to provide insights that can help raise awareness regarding environmental issues, inform the development of interventions, and adapt further actions to meet environmental challenges.

Social media is very popular for facilitating conversations about important topics and bringing forth insights and issues related to these topics. Reddit serves as a platform that fosters social interactions and hosts engaging discussions on a wide array of topics, thus forming narratives around these topics. One such topic is climate change. There are extensive discussions on Reddit about climate change, indicating high interest in its various aspects. In this paper, we explore 11 subreddits that discuss climate change for the duration of 2014 to 2022 and conduct a data-driven analysis of the posts on these subreddits. We present a basic characterization of the data and show the distribution of the posts and authors across our dataset for all years. Additionally, we analyze user engagement metrics like scores for the posts and how they change over time. We also offer insights into the topics of discussion across the subreddits, followed by entities referenced throughout the dataset

Researchers are developing mobile sensing platforms to facilitate public awareness of environmental conditions.

Display this feedback in real-time to the user posting or to the overall audience.     *   *Example:* After posting about a new recycling initiative, the platform could show a small visual indicator that indicates whether the sentiment is trending positive, negative, or neutral. *   **Targeted Content Recommendation:** Based on user sentiment and expressed emotions in previous posts, the platform can recommend more content that resonates with them. For example, if a user consistently expresses fear about climate change, the platform could suggest articles on solutions and actions they can take to mitigate those fears. *   **Highlight Positive Content:** Actively surface and amplify positive and hopeful content related to environmental progress and solutions. This can counteract the potential for overwhelming negativity and promote a sense of agency.  **2. Foster Interactive Discussions and Community Building (inspired by Reddit's format):**  *   **Dedicated Communities/Groups:** Create specific groups or sub-forums dedicated to environmental topics. These spaces can provide focused environments for in-depth discussions, Q&A sessions with experts, and sharing of experiences. *   **Moderated Discussions:** Employ active moderation to ensure respectful and constructive dialogue. Focus on promoting accurate information, fact-checking, and debunking misinformation related to environmental topics. *   **Themed Days/Weeks:** Organize themed days or weeks centered around specific environmental issues (e.g., Earth Day, World Environment Day). This can include contests, live Q&A sessions with experts, and educational content. *   **Encourage Storytelling:** Facilitate opportunities for users to share their personal stories and experiences related to environmental issues. Encourage visuals like photos and videos.  **3. Promote Action and Solutions (going beyond data presentation):**  *   **Easy Access to Information:** Provide links to reputable sources, educational resources, and fact-checking websites to combat misinformation. *   **Calls to Action:** Include clear and concise calls to action in posts. Examples:     *   Sign a petition.     *   Find a local environmental organization.     *   Learn about sustainable practices.     *   Share the post to raise awareness. *   **Highlight Success Stories:** Feature success stories of individuals, communities, and organizations making a positive impact on the environment. This can inspire others to take action and demonstrate that change is possible. *   **Integrate with Real-World Actions:** Connect users with opportunities to participate in local environmental initiatives or volunteer opportunities.  **4. Gamification and Incentives:**  *   **Quizzes and Polls:** Create interactive quizzes and polls on environmental topics to test knowledge and spark discussion. *   **Challenges and Contests:** Organize contests where users can share their sustainable practices or participate in environmentally friendly activities.
