7,gemini,How can a speaker use storytelling to make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience?,,5.59235692024231,"Storytelling is a powerful tool to make a talk on mental health relatable and impactful. Here's how a speaker can leverage storytelling to connect with their audience:  **1. Share Personal Anecdotes (If Comfortable):**  *   **Vulnerability Breeds Connection:**  Sharing your own experiences with mental health challenges, even if it's just a small part of your story, can create a sense of trust and understanding.  This shows you're human and not just an authority. *   **Consider What You Share:** Be mindful of your comfort level and the appropriateness for the context.  You don't need to reveal everything, but a carefully chosen anecdote can be incredibly effective. *   **Focus on the Journey:** Talk about the challenges, the moments of struggle, but also the coping mechanisms, the support you found, and the progress you made. This offers hope.  **2. Use Case Studies and Examples (With Permission):**  *   **Respect Privacy:**  If you're using examples of other people's experiences, **always get their permission** and ensure anonymity by changing details if necessary. *   **Focus on the Human Element:**  Choose compelling stories that highlight the emotional impact of mental health issues. Describe the person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. *   **Highlight Common Struggles:** Select stories that resonate with a broad audience by addressing common challenges like anxiety, depression, stress, or other relatable experiences. *   **Avoid Pathologizing:** Present the individual's journey without labeling them or focusing solely on their diagnosis. Focus on their experiences and how they navigated them.  **3. Build a Narrative Arc:**  *   **Introduction: Hook the Audience:** Start with a story that grabs attention. This could be a vivid description of a moment of struggle, a moment of hope, or a question related to a shared experience. *   **Rising Action: Detail the Struggle:** Show the challenges, the internal conflicts, and the external pressures the person faces. Build tension and empathy. *   **Climax: The Turning Point:** Describe a significant event or realization. This could be seeking help, making a breakthrough, or changing their perspective. *   **Falling Action: Coping and Recovery:**  Show the steps taken to manage mental health, the resources utilized, and the progress made. *   **Resolution: Hope and Resilience:** End with a message of hope, resilience, and the importance of seeking support. Emphasize that recovery is possible.  **4. Emphasize Sensory Details and Vivid Language:**  *   **Paint a Picture:** Use descriptive language to help the audience visualize and feel what the person in the story experienced. *   **Engage the Senses:** Describe sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures to create a more immersive experience. For example, instead of saying ""I was anxious,"" you might say, ""My heart pounded like a drum against my ribs, and my palms were slick with sweat.""  **5.  Focus on the Emotions:**  *   **Name the Emotions:** Clearly identify the emotions the person in the story is experiencing. For example, ""He felt overwhelmed by sadness and loneliness."" *   **Connect to the Audience's Feelings:**  Show how the story's emotions are universally human. For example, ""We've all felt moments of despair when it"

Structure Stories for Emotional Impact**   - **Start with a hook**: Open with a compelling moment (e.g., *""The day I realized I couldn’t get out of bed anymore…""*).   - **Build tension and resolution**: Describe the struggle, then show growth or coping strategies.   - **End with hope**: Leave the audience with a sense of possibility (e.g., recovery, resilience, or support).    ### **4. Connect to Universal Emotions**   - **Highlight shared feelings**: Talk about loneliness, fear, hope, or courage—emotions everyone understands.   - **Use metaphors and analogies**: Compare mental health struggles to familiar experiences (e.g., *""Anxiety is like an overactive smoke alarm—it goes off even when there’s no fire.""*).    ### **5. Make It Interactive**   - **Ask rhetorical questions**: *""Have you ever felt like you were drowning in your own thoughts?""*   - **Encourage reflection**: Pause to let the audience recall their own experiences.    ### **6. Balance Heavy Topics with Lightness**   - **Use humor carefully**: A well-placed, self-deprecating joke can ease tension without trivializing the issue.   - **Show progress**: Stories of small wins (e.g., *""The first time I asked for help…""*) make recovery feel achievable.    ### **7. Link to Actionable Takeaways**   - **Tie stories to lessons**: After sharing a struggle, offer practical advice (e.g., coping mechanisms, resources).   - **Call to action**: Inspire the audience to seek help, support others, or reduce stigma.    ### **Example Storytelling Approach:**   *""Three years ago, I stood on a stage just like this one—smiling, but inside, I felt completely alone. Anxiety had convinced me I was failing at everything. But then, a friend noticed. They didn’t offer a magic fix—just said, ‘I’m here.’ That small moment changed everything. Today, I want you to know: You don’t have to be okay all the time. And if you see someone struggling, sometimes just saying ‘I’m here’ can be the lifeline they need.""*    By weaving storytelling into a mental health talk, the speaker transforms abstract concepts into lived experiences, fostering empathy, connection, and motivation for change.

Here’s how they typically approach the problem:  ### **1. Automated Detection** - **AI & Machine Learning Models:** Platforms use natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to scan text, images, and videos for hate speech, slurs, and extremist symbols. - **Keyword & Pattern Matching:** Predefined lists of hateful terms, coded language (e.g., dog whistles), and known extremist phrases trigger automated flags. - **Behavioral Analysis:** Accounts that repeatedly post toxic content or engage in coordinated harassment are flagged for review. - **Contextual Understanding:** AI models assess whether a post is sarcastic, educational, or genuinely harmful (e.g., quoting hate speech vs. promoting it).  ### **2. Human Moderation** - **Content Review Teams:** Human moderators review flagged posts to determine if they violate policies. - **Third-Party Fact-Checkers:** Some platforms partner with external organizations to assess misinformation and hate speech. - **Escalation Protocols:** High-risk content (e.g., violent threats) is prioritized for immediate review.  ### **3. User Reporting & Community Feedback** - **Report Button:** Users can flag hateful posts, which are then reviewed by AI or humans. - **Crowdsourced Moderation:** Some platforms (like Reddit) rely on community moderators to enforce rules. - **Trusted Partner Programs:** NGOs and advocacy groups help identify harmful trends.  ### **4. Mitigation Strategies** - **Content Removal:** Posts violating policies are deleted. - **Shadow Banning/Limited Visibility:** Some platforms reduce the reach of borderline content without outright banning it. - **Account Suspension/Bans:** Repeat offenders face temporary or permanent bans. - **Warning Labels & Fact-Checks:** Misleading or harmful content may be labeled rather than removed (e.g., Twitter/X’s ""context"" notes). - **Algorithmic Demotion:** Hateful content is deprioritized in feeds and recommendations.  ### **5. Proactive Measures** - **Hate Speech Databases:** Platforms share known extremist content via initiatives like the **Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT)**. - **Policy Updates:** Rules evolve to address new forms of hate (e.g., deepfake harassment, anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric). - **User Education:** Some platforms promote digital literacy to help users recognize and report hate speech.  ### **Challenges** - **False Positives/Negatives:** AI may miss nuanced hate speech or over-censor legitimate discussions. - **Evolving Tactics:** Bad actors constantly adapt with coded language and new platforms. - **Free Speech Concerns:** Balancing moderation with free expression remains controversial.  ### **Future Improvements** - **Better AI Context Detection:** More sophisticated models to understand sarcasm, satire, and cultural context. - **Transparency Reports:** Platforms are under pressure to disclose moderation data. - **Decentralized Moderation:** Some propose community-based systems (e.g., Mastodon’s federated approach).

10,llama,What emotional tone inspires action in social issue posts?,,5.218279838562012,"To determine the emotional tone that inspires action in social issue posts, we need to consider the psychological and social factors that motivate individuals to engage with and act upon social causes. Various studies and analyses have explored this topic, providing insights into the types of emotional tones and messaging strategies that are most effective.  1. **Empathy and Hope**: Posts that evoke empathy by sharing personal stories or highlighting the human impact of a social issue can be very effective. When combined with a message of hope or a clear call to action, empathy can motivate people to get involved. Hope is crucial as it gives people a sense that their actions can lead to positive change.  2. **Anger and Outrage**: Content that provokes anger or outrage at injustice can also inspire action. This emotional tone is particularly effective when it is channeled into a constructive call to action, providing a clear pathway for individuals to express their feelings through engagement or activism.  3. **Inspirational and Positive Tone**: Messages that are positive and inspirational, highlighting successes or the impact of collective action, can motivate people. This tone encourages a sense of community and shared purpose, making individuals more likely to participate.  4. **Urgency and Importance**: Creating a sense of urgency around a social issue can prompt action. When people believe that their immediate engagement is necessary to address a problem, they are more likely to act.  5. **Personal Stories and Authenticity**: Using personal stories and authentic voices can make social issues more relatable and tangible. This approach can inspire empathy and motivate action by putting a human face to the issue.  6. **Clear Call to Action**: Regardless of the emotional tone, a clear and achievable call to action is crucial. It guides the audience on how they can contribute, making the task less overwhelming and more manageable.  In conclusion, the most effective emotional tone for inspiring action in social issue posts often involves a combination of elements such as empathy, hope, a clear call to action, and sometimes, a degree of urgency or outrage. The key is to motivate the audience without overwhelming them, and to provide a clear pathway for engagement.

10,mistral,What emotional tone inspires action in social issue posts?,,2.0498368740081787," The emotional tone that inspires action in social issue posts is often a combination of empathy, urgency, and hope.  1. Empathy: By showing understanding and compassion for the people affected by the issue, you can connect with your audience on a personal level. This can help to evoke an emotional response and motivate them to take action.  2. Urgency: Highlighting the immediate need for change and the potential consequences of inaction can create a sense of urgency. This can motivate people to act quickly and take steps to address the issue.  3. Hope: It's important to also convey a sense of hope and optimism. This can help to counteract feelings of despair or powerlessness, and encourage people to believe that their actions can make a difference.  4. Authenticity: Authenticity is key in social issue posts. People can often tell when a post is insincere or manipulative, and this can turn them off from engaging with the issue. Be genuine in your approach and let your passion for the cause shine through.  5. Actionable: Finally, make it clear what actions your audience can take to help address the issue. Provide specific steps they can take, and make it easy for them to do so. This can help to remove any barriers to action and increase the likelihood that people will take steps to make a difference."
10,gemini,What emotional tone inspires action in social issue posts?,,4.566269874572754,"The emotional tone that most effectively inspires action in social issue posts is a complex one, often involving a blend of several emotions. However, some key tones consistently drive action more than others:  *   **Empathy and Compassion:** Evoking empathy and compassion for the affected individuals or groups is crucial. This can be achieved by sharing personal stories, highlighting the human cost of the issue, and using language that fosters understanding and connection. When people feel empathy, they are more likely to want to help or take action.  *   **Outrage and Anger (Used Strategically):** While anger can be a powerful motivator, it needs to be used carefully. Outrage at the injustice or the scale of the problem can galvanize people to action. However, too much anger can lead to burnout and inaction. The most effective use of anger is often coupled with a clear call to action that provides a constructive outlet for those feelings.  *   **Hope and Optimism (Balanced with Reality):** A purely negative tone can discourage action. Injecting a sense of hope – a belief that things can get better – can motivate people to believe that their actions will make a difference. This hope should be grounded in reality, showcasing existing successes, highlighting potential solutions, and avoiding unrealistic promises.  *   **Urgency and Immediacy:** Creating a sense of urgency about the issue can prompt people to act sooner rather than later. This can be achieved by highlighting the immediate consequences of inaction, setting deadlines, or emphasizing the time-sensitive nature of the problem.  *   **Shared Responsibility and Solidarity:** Framing the issue as a shared challenge that requires collective action can foster a sense of responsibility and encourage people to work together. Highlighting the importance of community, shared values, and the power of collective efforts can inspire people to participate.  **Less Effective (or Potentially Counterproductive) Tones:**  *   **Guilt and Shame:** While guilt might motivate some, it can also lead to defensiveness and inaction. *   **Overly technical or academic language:** Can alienate a broader audience and fail to connect on an emotional level. *   **Passive language:** Posts that simply describe the problem without offering solutions or calls to action are less likely to inspire action. *   **Preaching or moralizing:** Can come across as condescending and alienate potential supporters.  **In summary:** Effective social issue posts often combine a range of emotional tones, carefully balancing empathy, outrage (where appropriate), hope, urgency, and a sense of shared responsibility to encourage people to take action. They also provide a clear call to action, empowering individuals with the knowledge of how they can contribute to a solution."

Urgency (Motivates Immediate Action)**      - **Example:** *""Thousands are at risk—we must act NOW before it's too late.""*      - **Why it works:** Creates a fear of missing out (FOMO) or a sense of crisis, pushing people to act quickly.    ### **2.

19,llama,What are some creative ways to photograph food for an Instagram post?,,7.672070264816284,"The art of food photography! Here are some creative ways to photograph food for an Instagram post:  1. **Play with lighting**: Natural light is always the best, so try to shoot near a window or outside. You can also experiment with artificial light sources like lamps or a ring light to create interesting shadows and highlights. 2. **Style your dish**: Make your food look appealing by adding garnishes, sauces, or other toppings. Use a variety of colors and textures to add visual interest. 3. **Experiment with angles**: Don't be afraid to get creative with your camera angles. Try shooting from directly above, at an angle, or from a low or high perspective. 4. **Use a shallow depth of field**: A shallow depth of field can help isolate the subject (your food) and create a beautiful bokeh (out-of-focus area) in the background. Use a wide-aperture lens or a smartphone with a portrait mode to achieve this effect. 5. **Add props**: Incorporate props like linens, utensils, or ingredients to add context and interest to your photo. Just be sure not to overdo it – you want the food to remain the star of the show. 6. **Capture the process**: Share the story behind your dish by photographing the preparation process. This can include shots of ingredients, cooking techniques, or the finished product. 7. **Get up close and personal**: Macro photography can be stunning for food. Get up close to your subject and capture the textures, patterns, and details of your dish. 8. **Use a reflective surface**: Place your food on a reflective surface like a marble countertop, a metallic tray, or a glass plate to add an extra layer of interest to your photo. 9. **Create a scene**: Set the scene for your dish by incorporating elements like a beautiful tablecloth, a vase with flowers, or a scenic background. 10. **Edit your photos**: Don't be afraid to edit your photos to enhance the colors, contrast, and overall look. Use Instagram's built-in filters or third-party apps like Lightroom or VSCO to give your photos a professional touch. 11. **Tell a story**: Use your food photography to tell a story. Share the inspiration behind your dish, the ingredients you used, or the occasion you're celebrating. 12. **Experiment with composition**: Play with composition by using the rule of thirds, symmetry, or negative space to create visually appealing photos. 13. **Capture the movement**: If you're photographing a dish with movement, like a pouring sauce or a sizzling skillet, try to capture the action. 14. **Use a consistent aesthetic**: Develop a consistent visual style for your Instagram feed by using a similar color palette, texture, or composition. 15. **Have fun**: Most importantly, have fun with it! Experiment with different techniques, and don't be afraid to try new things.  Some popular Instagram food photography trends include:  * **Flat lay**: A bird's-eye view of a dish or ingredients arranged on a flat surface. * **Overhead shot**: A shot taken directly above the food, often with a shallow depth of field. * **Close-up**: A tight shot of a specific ingredient or texture. * **Storytelling**: A series of photos that tell the story behind a dish or a meal.  By incorporating these creative techniques into your food photography, you'll be well on your way to creating stunning Instagram posts that will make your followers drool"
19,mistral,What are some creative ways to photograph food for an Instagram post?,,2.967611074447632," 1. Use Natural Light: Natural light is the best friend of food photographers. Find a well-lit area, preferably near a window, to capture your food. Avoid using flash as it can create harsh shadows.  2. Angles and Perspectives: Don't be afraid to experiment with different angles. Shoot from above, from the side, or even from below to create a unique perspective.  3. Plating and Styling: Arrange your food in an aesthetically pleasing way. Use color, texture, and composition to make your dish stand out. Consider adding garnishes, sauces, or props to enhance the visual appeal.  4. Focus on Details: Close-up shots can highlight the texture and details of your food, making it more appealing. Use a shallow depth of field to blur the background and make your subject stand out.  5. Use Props: Props can add context and personality to your food photos. This could be a plate, a utensil, a napkin, or even a tablecloth.  6. Storytelling: Tell a story with your food photos. This could be a step-by-step process of cooking, a before-and-after transformation, or a series of photos that show the journey of the food from market to plate.  7. Post-Processing: Use editing tools to enhance the colors, contrast, and brightness of your photos. However, be careful not to overdo it as you want your food to look as close to real life as possible.  8. Use a Tripod: A tripod can help you achieve sharp photos, especially in low light conditions. It also allows you to experiment with different angles and compositions without having to hold the camera.  9. Play with Shadows: Shadows can add depth and dimension to your photos. Experiment with creating interesting shadows by positioning your food and light sources strategically.  10. Get Creative with Composition: Don't always center your subject. Try rule of thirds, leading lines, or framing your subject with other elements to create a more dynamic composition."
19,gemini,What are some creative ways to photograph food for an Instagram post?,,5.225513219833374,"Let's get those food photos looking delicious! Here are some creative ways to photograph food for Instagram, broken down by technique and style:  **I. Lighting & Composition:**  *   **Natural Light is King:**     *   **Window Light:** Position your food near a window for soft, even lighting. Shoot at an angle for a dramatic effect or straight down for a flat lay. Experiment with the time of day – golden hour (sunrise/sunset) is magical!     *   **Diffused Light:** If the light is harsh, use a white sheet, thin curtain, or diffuser to soften the shadows.     *   **Reflectors:** Use a white or silver reflector (foam board, white paper) to bounce light back into the shadows, filling them in and adding dimension. *   **Creative Angles:**     *   **Flat Lay (Overhead):** Perfect for showing off multiple elements, ingredients, or a beautiful arrangement. Use props to create visual interest.     *   **Angled Shot (45 Degrees):** A classic angle that shows depth and detail. Great for showcasing textures and layers.     *   **Eye-Level:**  Ideal for food that's tall, stacked, or has a specific focal point (like a dripping sauce).  Make the viewer feel like they're about to eat it!     *   **Extreme Close-Up:**  Highlight textures, details (sprinkles, seeds, bubbles), and the overall visual appeal. Use a macro lens if you have one.     *   **Action Shots:** Catching a drizzle, a sprinkle, or a bite being taken can create dynamic images. *   **Rule of Thirds:**  Place your food off-center, along the grid lines, or at their intersections to create a more balanced and visually appealing composition. *   **Negative Space:** Don't be afraid to leave empty space in your photos. It can help draw the viewer's eye to the food and create a more minimalist and elegant feel.  **II. Styling & Props:**  *   **Props that Tell a Story:**     *   **Ingredients:** Include the ingredients that make up the dish. This adds context and visual appeal.     *   **Utensils:** Forks, knives, spoons, chopsticks. Use them to enhance the scene and show how the food is meant to be eaten.     *   **Textiles:**  Linens, napkins, tablecloths.  Choose colors and textures that complement your food and create the right mood.     *   **Serving Dishes & Plates:**  Experiment with different shapes, sizes, colors, and materials. Consider the overall aesthetic (rustic, modern, vintage).     *   **Backgrounds:**  Consider wooden surfaces, marble countertops, colorful backdrops, or even textured materials like tile or brick.     *   **Flowers & Foliage:**  Fresh herbs, flowers, or greenery can add pops of color and freshness.  Make sure they complement the food and don't overpower it. *   **Color Palette:**     *   **Complementary Colors:** Use colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., blue and orange) to create visual contrast and excitement.     *   **Analogous Colors:** Choose colors that are next to each other on the color wheel (e."

Tailor your explanation to their level of understanding and interests. 2. **Identify the core concept**: Break down the complex topic into its essential components and identify the central idea or key message. Focus on conveying this core concept clearly. 3. **Use analogies and metaphors**: Analogies and metaphors can help simplify complex ideas by relating them to more familiar concepts. For example, explaining a complex system as a ""machine"" or a ""network"" can make it more accessible. 4. **Use simple language**: Avoid using jargon or technical terms that might confuse your audience. Use simple, clear language that's easy to understand. 5. **Use storytelling techniques**: People remember stories better than facts and figures. Use narratives, examples, or anecdotes to illustrate complex concepts and make them more relatable. 6. **Visualize the information**: Visual aids like diagrams, charts, graphs, or images can help to simplify complex information and make it more engaging. Use visual elements to support your explanation and illustrate key points. 7. **Break it down into smaller chunks**: Divide the complex topic into smaller, manageable sections. This will help your audience follow your explanation and understand the topic more easily. 8. **Use examples and case studies**: Concrete examples and case studies can help illustrate complex concepts and make them more tangible. 9. **Make it interactive**: Encourage engagement by asking questions, soliciting feedback, or using interactive elements like quizzes or games. 10. **Practice and refine**: Rehearse your explanation several times to refine your delivery and ensure that you're conveying the complex topic in a clear and engaging way.  Some popular techniques for simplifying complex topics include:  1. **The Feynman Technique**: Teach the concept to a child or someone with no prior knowledge. This forces you to simplify the explanation and focus on the essential elements. 2. **The ""Explain it like I'm 5"" method**: Imagine explaining the complex topic to a 5-year-old. This helps to simplify the language and focus on the core concept. 3. **The ""What, So What, Now What"" framework**: Structure your explanation around three key questions: 	* What is the complex topic? (Provide a clear definition or overview.) 	* So what does it mean? (Explain the significance or implications.) 	* Now what can we do with this information? (Discuss the practical applications or next steps.)  By using these strategies and techniques, you can simplify complex topics and make them more engaging for your audience."

Tell a story: Stories are a powerful way to engage an audience and help them remember information. Use a story to illustrate the concept you're trying to explain.  5.

Avoid going off on tangents or getting too detailed. Focus on the key points and leave out the unnecessary details.  8. Use active voice: Using active voice makes your explanation more engaging and easier to follow. Instead of saying ""The process of photosynthesis involves the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen,"" say ""During photosynthesis, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.""  9. Use questions: Ask questions to engage your audience and keep them interested. This will also help you gauge their understanding and adjust your explanation as needed.  10.

Remember, everyone's skin is unique, so it's essential to listen to your skin and adjust as needed.  1. **Cleanse**: Use a gentle, fragrance-free, and non-abrasive cleanser.

Gently massage the cleanser onto your face, avoiding the eye area, and rinse with lukewarm water.  2. **Exfoliate**: Exfoliate once or twice a week with a product designed for sensitive skin. Look for physical exfoliants like oats or sugar, or chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid or lactic acid in low concentrations.

27,gemini,Share your skincare routine that works for sensitive skin.,,5.680718898773193,"Okay, here's my skincare routine that works well for my sensitive skin.  Keep in mind that what works for me might not work perfectly for you, as everyone's skin is unique!  It's always best to patch-test new products and introduce them slowly.  Also, I am not a dermatologist, so this is based on personal experience and general skincare knowledge.  **My Skin Type:**  Sensitive, prone to redness, occasional dryness, and easily irritated.  **Core Principles:**  Gentle, Hydrating, Minimal Ingredients, and Consistent.  **Morning Routine (AM):**  1.  **Cleanse:**     *   **Product:**  A very gentle, fragrance-free cleanser. Right now I love **CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**. (It's known for being gentle and contains ceramides). I use lukewarm water, massaging the cleanser in for about 30 seconds.  I avoid harsh scrubbing or washcloths, just gently splash and rinse. 2.  **Hydrate & Treat:**     *   **Product:** **The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5.** I apply this to slightly damp skin to lock in moisture. This helps hydrate and plump the skin. I also have been trying the **Paula's Choice RESIST Ultra-Light Antioxidant Serum**, it's a nice gentle antioxidant serum for sensitive skin. 3.  **Moisturize:**     *   **Product:** A lightweight, fragrance-free moisturizer.  I switch between a few depending on how my skin feels, but some of my favorites are **Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer** (very simple and hydrating) or **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream** (if I feel extra dry). 4.  **Sun Protection (Essential!):**     *   **Product:**  A mineral sunscreen (zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide) is crucial for sensitive skin because it's less likely to cause irritation.  I use **EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46** in the summer.  It's lightweight, and non-comedogenic (meaning it won't clog pores). I will use a mineral-based sunblock when I can find them in a great deal. I like **ThinkSport** Sunblock.  I apply a generous amount, about 1/4 teaspoon for my face, and reapply as needed throughout the day if I'm in the sun.  **Evening Routine (PM):**  1.  **Makeup Removal (If Applicable):**     *   **Product:**  A gentle, fragrance-free makeup remover. I typically use **Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water** on a cotton pad. This removes makeup and cleans the face. It's also very gentle.  If I've worn waterproof makeup, I may use a cleansing balm like **Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm**, which is generally good for sensitive skin, but I make sure to rinse thoroughly. 2.  **Cleanse:**     *   **Product:**  The same gentle cleanser I use in the morning (CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser) to remove any remaining impurities. 3.  **Treat (If Needed):**     *   **Product:**  Sometimes I add a serum.

28,llama,Share some advice you’d give to your younger self just starting college.,,9.311739206314087,"As I reflect on my college years, I'd like to share some advice that I wish I had known back then. If I could go back in time, I'd tell my younger self the following:  **Explore and be patient**: Don't feel pressured to declare a major right away. Take your time to explore different fields, attend career fairs, and talk to professors and professionals in various industries. I wish I had taken more time to figure out my interests and strengths before committing to a major.  **Get involved, but prioritize**: Joining clubs and organizations is a great way to meet new people and develop new skills. However, be mindful of your course load and other commitments. I learned the hard way that taking on too many extracurricular activities can lead to burnout. Prioritize your goals and focus on the activities that align with your interests and values.  **Time management is key**: College can be overwhelming, especially when you're balancing classes, assignments, and a social life. Develop good time management habits early on, such as using a planner or calendar to stay organized. I wish I had been more intentional with my time, as it would have reduced my stress levels and allowed me to enjoy my college experience more.  **Seek help when needed**: Don't be afraid to ask for help when you're struggling with a concept or assignment. Professors, teaching assistants, and classmates are all resources you can tap into. I remember feeling too proud to ask for help, but I eventually learned that it's okay to not know everything, and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.  **Take care of your mental and physical health**: College can be a high-stress environment, and it's easy to neglect your physical and mental well-being. Make time for self-care, exercise regularly, and eat a balanced diet. I wish I had taken better care of my mental health, as it would have made a big difference in my overall college experience.  **Build meaningful relationships**: The relationships you form in college can be some of the most significant and lasting of your life. Be intentional about building connections with your peers, professors, and mentors. I was fortunate to have some amazing friends and mentors, and I wish I had been more proactive in nurturing those relationships.  **Be open to new experiences**: College is a time to try new things, take risks, and step out of your comfort zone. Don't be afraid to take a class outside of your comfort zone or attend events that challenge your perspectives. I wish I had been more adventurous and open to new experiences, as it would have broadened my horizons and helped me grow as a person.  **Don't compare yourself to others**: It's easy to get caught up in comparing your academic performance, social life, or career prospects to those of your peers. Remember that everyone's journey is unique, and comparisons are unfair to yourself and others. I wish I had focused more on my own goals and progress, rather than comparing myself to others.  **Make the most of your resources**: Your college or university has a wealth of resources available to you, from academic support services to career counseling. Take advantage of these resources to help you succeed. I wish I had utilized more of the resources available to me, such as academic advising and career counseling, to help me navigate my college experience.  **Enjoy the journey**: College is a time of growth, discovery, and exploration. While it's natural to feel stressed or overwhelmed at times, try to enjoy the journey and make the most of"

Break down large assignments into smaller, manageable chunks.

Engage with the material, even if it's not your favorite subject. *   **Explore different subjects.** Take courses outside of your major! You might discover a passion you never knew you had.

Focus on understanding the underlying concepts and how things connect. *   **Read the syllabus!** Seriously.

The awkwardness fades; the lessons don’t.    ### **2. Prioritize relationships over perfection.**   Grades matter, but so do connections. The friendships, mentors, and even the difficult conversations will shape you more than a 4.0 ever could. Invest in people.    ### **3. Learn how to learn (not just memorize).**   College isn’t about regurgitating facts—it’s about critical thinking, problem-solving, and curiosity. Ask questions, challenge ideas, and seek understanding over shortcuts.    ### **4. Failure is data, not destiny.**   A bad grade, a rejected application, or a social misstep isn’t the end. Reflect, adjust, and keep going. Resilience is the most valuable skill you’ll build.    ### **5. Your major doesn’t define your future.**   Many people pivot careers multiple times. Study what excites you, but stay open to detours. Skills (like communication, adaptability, and creativity) transcend disciplines.    ### **6. Take care of your health—mental and physical.**   Sleep, move, and don’t ignore burnout. Seek help when you need it. No achievement is worth sacrificing your well-being.    ### **7.

29,gemini,Recommend some books that completely changed the way you think.,,5.093894958496094,"Okay, here are some books that have fundamentally shifted my thinking, along with a brief explanation of why:  *   **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman:** This book is a game-changer for understanding how our minds work. Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economics, explains the two systems that drive the way we think: System 1 (fast, intuitive, emotional) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, logical). It sheds light on cognitive biases, heuristics, and how these influence our decisions in everything from personal finances to political judgments. It made me far more aware of my own mental shortcuts and biases, leading me to be more skeptical of my own assumptions and more willing to consider alternative perspectives.  *   **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari:** This book offers a sweeping look at the history of humanity, from the Stone Age to the present day. Harari weaves together history, biology, philosophy, and economics to explore the big questions: What makes us human? How did we get here? What is the future of our species? It challenged my assumptions about the inevitability of certain historical trajectories and helped me understand the power of storytelling and shared beliefs in shaping human civilization. It made me question the ""naturalness"" of many things we take for granted.  *   **Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl:** A profoundly moving book based on Frankl's experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps. He argues that the primary driving force in human life is not pleasure, as Freud believed, but the search for meaning. Even in the face of extreme suffering, Frankl found that those who had a sense of purpose were more likely to survive. This book reshaped my view on suffering, resilience, and the importance of finding meaning in life, regardless of external circumstances. It taught me about the power of perspective and the human spirit.  *   **The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel van der Kolk:** This book explores the profound impact of trauma on the body and mind. Van der Kolk, a leading trauma researcher, explains how trauma can alter brain function, disrupt relationships, and lead to physical and emotional problems. It changed my understanding of mental health, addiction, and the importance of a holistic approach to healing, focusing on the connection between the body and the mind. It's made me more compassionate and understanding of the experiences of others.  *   **Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond:** Diamond explores the factors that have shaped the course of human history, from the agricultural revolution to the rise of empires. He argues that geography, climate, and access to resources have played a significant role in determining the success and failure of different societies. It expanded my understanding of historical context, challenging simplistic explanations for global inequalities, and emphasizing the importance of environment and its impact on society.  *   **A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking:** This book offers a clear and accessible introduction to cosmology and astrophysics. It delves into the mysteries of the universe, exploring black holes, the Big Bang, and the nature of time. This book broadened my perspective on the universe, making me question the limitations of human understanding and appreciate the vastness and complexity of the cosmos.  *   **Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki"

1,deepseek_rag,Generate a detailed research question on the application of machine learning in climate modeling.,"Recent achievements in machine learning (Ml) have had a significant impact on various fields, including climate science. Climate modeling is very important and plays a crucial role in shaping the decisions of governments and individuals in mitigating the impact of climate change. Climate change poses a serious threat to humanity, however, current climate models are limited by computational costs, uncertainties, and biases, affecting their prediction accuracy. The vast amount of climate data generated by satellites, radars, and earth system models (ESMS) poses a significant challenge. ML techniques can be effectively employed to analyze this data and extract valuable insights that aid in our understanding of the earth climate. This review paper focuses on how ml has been utilized in the last 5 years to boost the current state-of-the-art climate models. We invite the ml community to join in the global effort to accurately model the earth climate by collaborating with other fields to leverage ml as a powerful tool in this endeavor.

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as machine learning experts, may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how machine learning can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids to disaster management, we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by machine learning, in collaboration with other fields. Our recommendations encompass exciting research questions as well as promising business opportunities. We call on the machine learning community to join the global effort against climate change.

Modern weather and climate models share a common heritage, and often even components, however they are used in different ways to answer fundamentally different questions. As such, attempts to emulate them using machine learning should reflect this. While the use of machine learning to emulate weather forecast models is a relatively new endeavour there is a rich history of climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is an initial condition problem which intimately depends on the current state of the atmosphere, climate modelling is predominantly a boundary condition problem. In order to emulate the response of the climate to different drivers therefore, representation of the full dynamical evolution of the atmosphere is neither necessary, or in many cases, desirable. Climate scientists are typically interested in different questions also. Indeed emulating the steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g. parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the large datasets, non-linear relationships and limited training data make Climate a domain which is rich in interesting machine learning challenges. Here I seek to set out the current state of climate model emulation and demonstrate how, despite some challenges, recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for creating useful statistical models of the climate.",10.93117380142212,"Here’s a detailed and well-structured research question based on your provided context:    **""How can machine learning techniques be leveraged to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of climate models by addressing key challenges such as computational cost, uncertainty quantification, and bias correction, while integrating multi-source climate data from satellites, radars, and Earth System Models (ESMs)?""**    ### Breakdown of the Research Question:   1. **Objective (What?)**      - Improve climate models in terms of **accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability**.    2. **Method (How?)**      - Apply **machine learning techniques** (e.g., deep learning, ensemble methods, physics-informed ML).    3. **Key Challenges Addressed (Why?)**      - **Computational cost** (ML can accelerate simulations via emulation or surrogate modeling).      - **Uncertainty quantification** (probabilistic ML methods to assess model confidence).      - **Bias correction** (ML for post-processing climate model outputs).    4. **Data Integration (From Where?)**      - Leverage **multi-source climate data** (satellite observations, radar, ESMs).    5. **Scope & Relevance**      - Aligns with recent ML advancements in climate science (last 5 years).      - Encourages interdisciplinary collaboration (ML + climate science).    ### Potential Sub-Questions for Further Exploration:   - Can **physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)** improve climate model generalization while preserving physical consistency?   - How can **generative models (e.g., diffusion models, GANs)** be used for high-resolution climate downscaling?   - What role does **causal ML** play in disentangling anthropogenic vs. natural climate drivers?   - Can **reinforcement learning** optimize climate intervention strategies (e.g., geoengineering)?

3,llama_rag,What are the best practices for creating a viral trend on Instagram?,"Social media generates a prodigious wealth of real-time content at an incessant rate. From all the content that people create and share, only a few topics manage to attract enough attention to rise to the top and become temporal trends which are displayed to users. The question of what factors cause the formation and persistence of trends is an important one that has not been answered yet. In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending topics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation, persistence and decay of trends. We also demonstrate empirically how factors such as user activity and number of followers do not contribute strongly to trend creation and its propagation. In fact, we find that the resonance of the content with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing trends.

In addition to more personalized content feeds, some leading social media platforms give a prominent role to content that is more widely popular. On Twitter, ""trending topics"" identify popular topics of conversation on the platform, thereby promoting popular content which users might not have otherwise seen through their network. Hence, ""trending topics"" potentially play important roles in influencing the topics users engage with on a particular day. Using two carefully constructed data sets from India and Turkey, we study the effects of a hashtag appearing on the trending topics page on the number of tweets produced with that hashtag. We specifically aim to answer the question: How many new tweeting using that hashtag appear because a hashtag is labeled as trending? We distinguish the effects of the trending topics page from network exposure and find there is a statistically significant, but modest, return to a hashtag being featured on trending topics. Analysis of the types of users impacted by trending topics shows that the feature helps less popular and new users to discover and spread content outside their network, which they otherwise might not have been able to do.

We distinguish the effects of the trending topics page from network exposure and find there is a statistically significant, but modest, return to a hashtag being featured on trending topics. Analysis of the types of users impacted by trending topics shows that the feature helps less popular and new users to discover and spread content outside their network, which they otherwise might not have been able to do.

Searching for influential spreaders in complex networks is an issue of great significance for applications across various domains, ranging from the epidemic control, innovation diffusion, viral marketing, social movement to idea propagation. In this paper, we first display some of the most important theoretical models that describe spreading processes, and then discuss the problem of locating both the individual and multiple influential spreaders respectively. Recent approaches in these two topics are presented. For the identification of privileged single spreaders, we summarize several widely used centralities, such as degree, betweenness centrality, PageRank, k-shell, etc. We investigate the empirical diffusion data in a large scale online social community -- LiveJournal. With this extensive dataset, we find that various measures can convey very distinct information of nodes. Of all the users in LiveJournal social network, only a small fraction of them involve in spreading. For the spreading processes in LiveJournal, while degree can locate nodes participating in information diffusion with higher probability, k-shell is more effective in finding nodes with large influence.

It provides a good foundation, but we need to translate these general principles to Instagram's unique environment.  Here's a breakdown of the key takeaways and how they apply to Instagram, along with best practices for creating a viral trend on the platform:  **Key Takeaways from the Text (and their Instagram relevance):**  *   **Resonance of Content (Most Important):**  The core of a trend is content that **resonates** with users. This means it connects with their emotions, interests, values, or aspirations. On Instagram, this translates to content that is:     *   Visually appealing and engaging.     *   Relatable.     *   Emotionally evocative (happy, sad, funny, inspiring, etc.).     *   Entertaining or informative.     *   Timely and relevant to current events or cultural moments. *   **Trending Topics as a Push:**  Being featured as a ""trending topic"" on Twitter provides a boost. On Instagram, this translates to a combination of factors:     *   Being featured on the Explore page (this is Instagram's version of trending).     *   Using relevant hashtags that are currently popular.     *   Getting your content boosted/promoted by other accounts (influencers, popular pages). *   **Impact on Less Popular and New Users:**  Trends can help lesser-known accounts gain visibility. On Instagram:     *   Using trending hashtags can help smaller accounts reach a wider audience.     *   Collaborating with larger accounts or participating in challenges can provide exposure. *   **Spreading Through a Network:** Spreading relies on nodes (users) sharing content. On Instagram:     *   **Influencer marketing** is a core part of spreading (influencers act as nodes).     *   **User-generated content** can drive organic sharing.     *   **Shares, saves, and comments** are the currency of engagement, and increase a posts visibility  **Best Practices for Creating a Viral Trend on Instagram (Combining the Insights with Instagram-Specific Knowledge):**  1.  **Understand Your Audience:**     *   **Demographics:** Age, location, interests, etc.     *   **Psychographics:** Values, motivations, pain points, aspirations.     *   **What are they already engaging with?**  Observe their behavior, hashtags they use, accounts they follow.  2.  **Identify the Hook (The Resonant Content):**     *   **Emotional Connection:** Tap into universal emotions (joy, fear, nostalgia, anger, etc.).     *   **Problem/Solution:** Offer a solution to a common problem, or provide a new perspective.     *   **Relatability:** Create content that reflects everyday life, humor, or shared experiences.     *   **Innovation:** Present a unique idea, perspective, or format.     *   **Trending Topics/Newsjacking:** Leverage current events, holidays, memes, or popular culture.  3.  **Craft Compelling Content:**     *   **High-Quality Visuals:**  Stunning photos or videos are essential.     *   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent brand aesthetic and posting"
3,deepseek_rag,What are the best practices for creating a viral trend on Instagram?,"Social media generates a prodigious wealth of real-time content at an incessant rate. From all the content that people create and share, only a few topics manage to attract enough attention to rise to the top and become temporal trends which are displayed to users. The question of what factors cause the formation and persistence of trends is an important one that has not been answered yet. In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending topics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation, persistence and decay of trends. We also demonstrate empirically how factors such as user activity and number of followers do not contribute strongly to trend creation and its propagation. In fact, we find that the resonance of the content with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing trends.

In addition to more personalized content feeds, some leading social media platforms give a prominent role to content that is more widely popular. On Twitter, ""trending topics"" identify popular topics of conversation on the platform, thereby promoting popular content which users might not have otherwise seen through their network. Hence, ""trending topics"" potentially play important roles in influencing the topics users engage with on a particular day. Using two carefully constructed data sets from India and Turkey, we study the effects of a hashtag appearing on the trending topics page on the number of tweets produced with that hashtag. We specifically aim to answer the question: How many new tweeting using that hashtag appear because a hashtag is labeled as trending? We distinguish the effects of the trending topics page from network exposure and find there is a statistically significant, but modest, return to a hashtag being featured on trending topics.

While there’s no guaranteed formula, research from social media studies (like the Twitter and LiveJournal analyses you referenced) suggests key principles that can increase the likelihood of virality. Here are the best practices:  ---  ### **1. Leverage Emotional Resonance** - **Why it works**: The Twitter study highlights that content resonating with users drives trends more than follower count or activity.   - **How to apply it**:     - **High-arousal emotions**: Content that evokes awe, humor, surprise, or outrage spreads faster.     - **Relatability**: Trends often tap into shared experiences (e.g., challenges like #IceBucketChallenge, memes like #DistractedBoyfriend).     - **Storytelling**: Use narratives that feel personal yet universal (e.g., #10YearChallenge).    ---  ### **2. Optimize for Shareability** - **Why it works**: The LiveJournal study shows that spreadability depends on network structure and user engagement.   - **How to apply it**:     - **Low friction**: Make it easy to participate (e.g., templates, filters, or duets).     - **User-generated content (UGC)**: Encourage participation (e.g., #DollyPartonChallenge).     - **Incentivize sharing**: Use gamification (e.g., voting, tagging friends).    ---  ### **3. Capitalize on Timing and Trends** - **Why it works**: Trending topics gain momentum from real-time relevance (as seen in the Twitter study).   - **How to apply it**:     - **Hijack trends**: Align with current events, holidays, or viral memes (e.g., #BarbieMovie during its release).     - **Post at peak times**: Use Instagram Insights to find when your audience is most active.    ---  ### **4. Leverage Network Effects** - **Why it works**: The Twitter study notes that trending topics help less popular users break through.   - **How to apply it**:     - **Micro-influencers**: Partner with niche creators who have highly engaged followers.     - **Cross-platform sharing**: Seed the trend on TikTok/Reddit to fuel Instagram traction.    ---  ### **5. Design for Visual Impact** - **Why it works**: Instagram is visually driven; standout aesthetics get attention.   - **How to apply it**:     - **Consistent branding**: Use colors/fonts that align with your trend’s theme.     - **Video-first**: Reels dominate Instagram’s algorithm; use hooks in the first 3 seconds.    ---  ### **6. Foster Community Participation** - **Why it works**: Trends persist when users feel ownership (e.g., #BlackLivesMatter).   - **How to apply it**:     - **Call-to-action (CTA)**: Use clear prompts like ""Tag 3 friends"" or ""Try this & reply with your result.""     - **Highlight participants**: Repost UGC to validate contributors.    ---  ### **7. Seed Strategically** - **Why it works**: The LiveJournal study shows that influential spreaders (even mid-tier users) can amplify reach.   - **How to apply it**:     - **Influencer partnerships**: Collaborate with accounts in the"

5,llama_rag,Describe the key elements that make a motivational speech impactful for a global audience.,"One problem that every presenter faces when delivering a public discourse is how to hold the listeners' attentions or to keep them involved. Therefore, many studies in conversation analysis work on this issue and suggest qualitatively con-structions that can effectively lead to audience's applause. To investigate these proposals quantitatively, in this study we an-alyze the transcripts of 2,135 TED Talks, with a particular fo-cus on the rhetorical devices that are used by the presenters for applause elicitation. Through conducting regression anal-ysis, we identify and interpret 24 rhetorical devices as triggers of audience applauding. We further build models that can rec-ognize applause-evoking sentences and conclude this work with potential implications.

The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable and prevalent, and can be used to produce creative content. The quality of content is influenced by the prompt used, with more specific prompts that incorporate examples generally producing better results. On from this, it could be seen that using instructions written for crowdsourcing tasks (that are specific and include examples to guide workers) could prove effective LLM prompts. To explore this, we used a previous crowdsourcing pipeline that gave examples to people to help them generate a collectively diverse corpus of motivational messages. We then used this same pipeline to generate messages using GPT-4, and compared the collective diversity of messages from: (1) crowd-writers, (2) GPT-4 using the pipeline, and (3 & 4) two baseline GPT-4 prompts. We found that the LLM prompts using the crowdsourcing pipeline caused GPT-4 to produce more diverse messages than the two baseline prompts. We also discuss implications from messages generated by both human writers and LLMs.",3.652074098587036,"Although the provided text does not directly describe the key elements of a motivational speech, we can infer some relevant information from the third passage, which discusses the generation of motivational messages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The study found that using specific prompts that incorporate examples can produce more diverse and effective motivational messages.  To make a motivational speech impactful for a global audience, the following key elements can be considered:  1. **Specificity and clarity**: A clear and specific message is more likely to resonate with the audience. The study on LLMs suggests that using specific prompts with examples can lead to more effective motivational messages. 2. **Diversity and inclusivity**: A motivational speech that acknowledges and appreciates the diversity of the global audience can be more impactful. The study found that using a crowdsourcing pipeline to generate messages resulted in a more diverse set of motivational messages. 3. **Relevance and relatability**: A speech that is relevant to the audience's experiences and concerns can be more motivating. The use of examples and anecdotes can help make the message more relatable. 4. **Emotional resonance**: A motivational speech that evokes emotions can be more impactful. While the text does not directly discuss this, the study on TED Talks (first passage) identifies rhetorical devices that can elicit applause, suggesting that emotional resonance is an important factor.  By incorporating these elements, a motivational speech can be made more impactful for a global audience."

Universal Themes: Focus on themes that transcend cultural boundaries, such as hope, resilience, and the pursuit of excellence. These themes can inspire and motivate people from diverse backgrounds.  2. Storytelling: Use compelling narratives to illustrate your points. Stories can help audiences connect emotionally with your message and remember it more effectively.  3. Simplicity: Keep your language simple and clear to ensure your message is easily understood by a wide audience. Avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some listeners.  4. Authenticity: Be genuine and sincere in your delivery. Authenticity can help build trust and rapport with your audience, making them more receptive to your message.  5. Engagement: Encourage audience participation through questions, interactive activities, or calls to action. This can help keep listeners engaged and invested in your speech.  6. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes that may offend or alienate certain groups. Research and adapt your speech to be sensitive to the cultural context of your audience.  7. Emotional Appeal: Use emotional language and anecdotes to evoke feelings of empathy, inspiration, or motivation in your audience.

Therefore, many studies in conversation analysis work on this issue and suggest qualitatively con-structions that can effectively lead to audience's applause. To investigate these proposals quantitatively, in this study we an-alyze the transcripts of 2,135 TED Talks, with a particular fo-cus on the rhetorical devices that are used by the presenters for applause elicitation.

The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable and prevalent, and can be used to produce creative content. The quality of content is influenced by the prompt used, with more specific prompts that incorporate examples generally producing better results. On from this, it could be seen that using instructions written for crowdsourcing tasks (that are specific and include examples to guide workers) could prove effective LLM prompts. To explore this, we used a previous crowdsourcing pipeline that gave examples to people to help them generate a collectively diverse corpus of motivational messages. We then used this same pipeline to generate messages using GPT-4, and compared the collective diversity of messages from: (1) crowd-writers, (2) GPT-4 using the pipeline, and (3 & 4) two baseline GPT-4 prompts. We found that the LLM prompts using the crowdsourcing pipeline caused GPT-4 to produce more diverse messages than the two baseline prompts.

Universality and Relatability:**  *   **Cross-Cultural Themes:** A truly global motivational speech avoids being overly specific to any single culture. It focuses on universal human experiences, emotions, and aspirations. The core values of hope, resilience, perseverance, growth, and connection resonate across diverse cultural backgrounds. *   **Shared Experiences:** While avoiding cultural specifics, the speaker should address common human experiences such as overcoming adversity, achieving goals, building relationships, and finding purpose. *   **Avoidance of Jargon/Slang:** Use clear, concise language. Avoid overly complex language or slang that might not translate well or be understood by all listeners.  **2. Emotional Engagement (Applause Elicitation)**  *   **Rhetorical Devices (From the TED Talk Study):**     *   The research on TED Talks highlights the importance of understanding how presenters generate audience applause.     *   The study identified 24 rhetorical devices that trigger applause. Analyzing these devices and how they can be adapted for different cultures is crucial. These devices include, but are not limited to, asking rhetorical questions, using humor, storytelling, making bold statements, and offering thought-provoking conclusions.     *   Use of these devices helps maintain attention and keep the audience engaged. *   **Storytelling:**     *   The use of powerful narratives and personal anecdotes is critical. Stories create an emotional connection, making the message more memorable and relatable.     *   Stories should be carefully chosen to represent diverse experiences, avoiding stories that are culturally insensitive. *   **Emotional Connection:**     *   The speaker needs to show vulnerability and authenticity to connect with the audience. This allows them to empathize.     *   Show emotions such as joy, empathy, and passion to inspire the audience.  **3. Clarity and Accessibility:**  *   **Simple Language:** The speech should be easy to understand regardless of the audience's native language. *   **Clear Structure:** A well-organized speech with a clear beginning, middle, and end helps the audience follow the message. *   **Visual Aids (If Applicable):** Use visuals such as images, videos, or graphics to support the message and enhance understanding. Ensure the visuals are culturally sensitive and appropriate. *   **Subtitles and Translations:** Consider making the speech available with subtitles or translated versions, allowing a wider audience to understand the content, especially online content.  **4. Inspiration and Empowerment:**  *   **Clear Call to Action:** Provide the audience with a specific set of actions to take after the speech. Provide the audience with tangible steps towards achieving the message. *   **Uplifting and Positive Tone:** The tone should be optimistic and inspiring. Focus on the potential for growth, the power of individual effort, and the possibilities of a better future. *   **Motivation:** Inspire and motivate the audience by offering specific ideas and ways that the audience can work toward the message.  **5.

Diversity is more than just a buzzword; it is the recognition and celebration of the myriad ways in which individuals differ—be it in race, gender, nationality, age, thought, or experience. It is the acknowledgment that our differences are not obstacles but rather the very strengths that drive innovation, creativity, and deeper understanding. In science, as in life, diversity is not merely a moral imperative—it is a **strategic advantage**.    Today, we gather to reflect on the beauty of diversity in our world, particularly within the scientific community. The Belle II Collaboration’s presentation at ICHEP 2020 marked a significant milestone—our first external discussion on diversity and inclusion in high-energy physics. Through data and self-reported statistics, we highlighted both the progress we’ve made and the gaps that still exist in representation and inclusivity within our field.    But why does diversity matter so deeply in science?    Diversity indices—quantitative measures that capture the distribution of attributes across a population—help us understand the complexity of human and scientific ecosystems. These metrics are not just abstract numbers; they reflect real-world dynamics in fields as varied as ecology, immunology, socioeconomic studies, and, of course, physics. Whether we are studying biodiversity in an ecosystem, immune system variability, or the composition of a research collaboration, diversity shapes outcomes in profound ways.    Yet, despite its universality, diversity remains an area where many scientific communities—including high-energy physics—still have much work to do. Representation gaps persist, and fostering an inclusive environment requires intentional, sustained effort.    In this talk, we will explore:   - The **mathematical and conceptual foundations** of diversity,   - Its **critical role in scientific discovery**,   - The **current state of diversity in Belle II and high-energy physics**,   - And the **steps we are taking—and must continue to take—to build a more inclusive future**.    The journey toward true diversity and inclusion is ongoing, but it is one that enriches not only our collaborations but also the science we produce. By embracing diversity in all its forms, we unlock new perspectives, challenge assumptions, and ultimately, push the boundaries of what is possible.    Let us begin this conversation with curiosity, openness, and a shared commitment to progress.    Thank you."
7,llama_rag,How can a speaker use storytelling to make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience?,"Stories about overcoming personal struggles can effectively illustrate the application of psychological theories in real life, yet they may fail to resonate with individuals' experiences. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to create tailored narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals. Our study, involving 346 young adults across two settings, demonstrates that personalized LLM-enhanced stories were perceived to be better than human-written ones in conveying key takeaways, promoting reflection, and reducing belief in negative thoughts. These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.

Immersive stories for health are 360-degree videos that intend to alter viewer perceptions about behaviors detrimental to health. They have potential to inform public health at scale, however, immersive story design is still in early stages and largely devoid of best practices. This paper presents a focus group study with 147 viewers of an immersive story about binge drinking experienced through VR headsets and mobile phones. The objective of the study is to identify aspects of immersive story design that influence attitudes towards the health issue exhibited, and to understand how health information is consumed in immersive stories. Findings emphasize the need for an immersive story to provide reasoning behind character engagement in the focal health behavior, to show the main character clearly engaging in the behavior, and to enable viewers to experience escalating symptoms of the behavior before the penultimate health consequence. Findings also show how the design of supporting characters can inadvertently distract viewers and lead them to justify the detrimental behavior being exhibited. The paper concludes with design considerations for enabling immersive stories to better inform public perception of health issues.

Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMI), particularly schizophrenia, experience complex and intense emotions frequently. They increasingly turn to vlogging as an authentic medium for emotional disclosure and online support-seeking. While previous research has primarily focused on text-based disclosure, little is known about how people construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences through video blogs. Our study analyzed 401 YouTube videos created by schizophrenia vloggers, revealing that vloggers disclosed their fear, sadness, and joy through verbal narration by explicit expressions or storytelling. Visually, they employed various framing styles, including Anonymous, Talk-to-Camera, and In-the-Moment approaches, along with diverse visual narration techniques. Notably, we uncovered a concerning 'visual appeal disparity' in audience engagement, with visually appealing videos receiving significantly more views, likes, and comments. This study discusses the role of video-sharing platforms in emotional expression and offers design implications for fostering online care-seeking for emotionally vulnerable populations.",6.092132806777954,"## Using Storytelling to Make a Talk on Mental Health More Relatable  To make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience, a speaker can effectively use storytelling. Here are some ways to do so, backed by research on narrative-based interventions and immersive storytelling:  ### Personalizing Stories  1. **Share personal experiences**: The speaker can share their own struggles with mental health, making the topic more personal and relatable. Research has shown that personalized stories can be more effective in conveying key takeaways and promoting reflection (Source: Study on LLM-enhanced stories). 2. **Use tailored narratives**: The speaker can use stories that are tailored to the audience's specific needs and experiences. This can be achieved by using large language models (LLMs) to create personalized narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals.  ### Creating Immersive Experiences  1. **Use vivid descriptions and imagery**: The speaker can use vivid descriptions and imagery to create an immersive experience for the audience, making the story more engaging and memorable. Research on immersive stories has shown that they can be effective in altering viewer perceptions about behaviors detrimental to health (Source: Study on immersive stories). 2. **Show, don't tell**: Instead of simply telling the audience about a mental health issue, the speaker can use storytelling to show the audience what it's like to experience it. This can be achieved by using descriptive language and anecdotes to bring the story to life.  ### Designing Effective Stories  1. **Provide context and reasoning**: The speaker should provide context and reasoning behind the character's or individual's actions and emotions, helping the audience understand the complexities of mental health. Research has shown that providing reasoning behind character engagement in a focal health behavior is crucial in immersive story design (Source: Study on immersive stories). 2. **Use diverse storytelling techniques**: The speaker can use diverse storytelling techniques, such as different framing styles and visual narration techniques, to convey emotions and experiences. Research on vlogging has shown that individuals with severe mental illnesses use various techniques to disclose their emotions and experiences (Source: Study on vlogging).  ### Best Practices  1. **Be authentic and genuine**: The speaker should be authentic and genuine in their storytelling, avoiding sensationalism or exploitation. Research has shown that authenticity is crucial in narrative-based interventions (Source: Study on LLM-enhanced stories). 2. **Be mindful of the audience**: The speaker should be mindful of the audience's needs and sensitivities, avoiding triggers or uncomfortable themes. Research has shown that audience engagement can be influenced by the design of supporting characters and the overall narrative (Source: Study on immersive stories).  By incorporating these strategies into their talk, a speaker can use storytelling to make a talk on mental health more relatable, engaging, and memorable for the audience."

These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.

Immersive stories for health are 360-degree videos that intend to alter viewer perceptions about behaviors detrimental to health. They have potential to inform public health at scale, however, immersive story design is still in early stages and largely devoid of best practices. This paper presents a focus group study with 147 viewers of an immersive story about binge drinking experienced through VR headsets and mobile phones. The objective of the study is to identify aspects of immersive story design that influence attitudes towards the health issue exhibited, and to understand how health information is consumed in immersive stories. Findings emphasize the need for an immersive story to provide reasoning behind character engagement in the focal health behavior, to show the main character clearly engaging in the behavior, and to enable viewers to experience escalating symptoms of the behavior before the penultimate health consequence. Findings also show how the design of supporting characters can inadvertently distract viewers and lead them to justify the detrimental behavior being exhibited. The paper concludes with design considerations for enabling immersive stories to better inform public perception of health issues.

Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMI), particularly schizophrenia, experience complex and intense emotions frequently. They increasingly turn to vlogging as an authentic medium for emotional disclosure and online support-seeking. While previous research has primarily focused on text-based disclosure, little is known about how people construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences through video blogs. Our study analyzed 401 YouTube videos created by schizophrenia vloggers, revealing that vloggers disclosed their fear, sadness, and joy through verbal narration by explicit expressions or storytelling. Visually, they employed various framing styles, including Anonymous, Talk-to-Camera, and In-the-Moment approaches, along with diverse visual narration techniques. Notably, we uncovered a concerning 'visual appeal disparity' in audience engagement, with visually appealing videos receiving significantly more views, likes, and comments. This study discusses the role of video-sharing platforms in emotional expression and offers design implications for fostering online care-seeking for emotionally vulnerable populations.",3.1694798469543457," To make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience, a speaker can use storytelling by incorporating the following strategies:  1. Personalized narratives: Use large language models (LLMs) to create tailored stories that acknowledge and address unique mental health challenges faced by individuals. These stories should be relatable, authentic, and not implausible.  2. Emotional disclosure: Share personal experiences of complex and intense emotions, such as fear, sadness, and joy, to connect with the audience on an emotional level.  3. Storytelling through video: Utilize video blogs (vlogs) to visually demonstrate emotional experiences and engage the audience. This can help to create a more authentic and relatable connection.  4. Visual narration techniques: Employ various framing styles, such as Anonymous, Talk-to-Camera, and In-the-Moment approaches, to visually narrate emotional experiences.  5. Reasoning behind behavior: Provide reasoning behind the characters' engagement in mental health behaviors, such as substance abuse or self-harm, to help the audience understand the motivations behind these actions.  6. Escalating symptoms: Show the main character clearly engaging in the detrimental behavior and experiencing escalating symptoms before the penultimate health consequence. This can help the audience understand the progression of the mental health issue and its impact on the individual.  7. Supporting characters: Design supporting characters carefully to avoid inadvertently distracting the audience or leading them to justify the detrimental behavior being exhibited.  8. Emotional appeal: Ensure that the story has an emotional appeal, as visually appealing videos tend to receive more views, likes, and comments, which can help to increase the reach and impact of the talk.  By incorporating these storytelling strategies, a speaker can create a more relatable and engaging talk on mental health that resonates with the audience and promotes reflection and understanding of mental health issues."

Here's how a speaker can leverage storytelling to make a talk on mental health more relatable, drawing on the research:  **1. Personalization and Relatability (Inspired by the LLM Study):**  *   **Embrace Vulnerability (But Be Mindful):** The LLM study highlights the power of personalized narratives. While you can't have an AI tailor a story in real-time, *you* can tell stories that are **specifically crafted to address common challenges and thought patterns*. This means acknowledging the diverse experiences of the audience, rather than presenting a single, monolithic experience. *   **Acknowledge the Spectrum:** Mental health is not a one-size-fits-all issue. Don't assume everyone has the same struggles. **Frame your stories as *examples* of how things can manifest, not as universal truths.** *   **Focus on Specific Thoughts and Situations:** Instead of broad generalizations (""I felt depressed""), share details about specific negative thoughts, difficult situations, and the *reactions* they triggered (""When I lost my job, I felt like a failure and started isolating myself""). This allows the audience to connect with the specific emotional experience. *   **Use a Conversational Tone:** The LLM study found that wording and tone are crucial. **Speak as if you are talking to a friend.** Avoid overly clinical language or jargon. *   **The Authenticity Balance:** The LLM study also suggests that stories must feel believable. Don't fabricate overly dramatic experiences. Authenticity is key. Be genuine.  **2. Structure and Narrative Techniques (Inspired by the Immersive Story and Vlogging Studies):**  *   **Show, Don't Just Tell (Visuals if Available):** The immersive story study emphasizes the importance of *showing* the health issue and its consequences. Even without VR, use vivid language and imagery to paint a picture. *   **Focus on Character Engagement and Reasoning:** The immersive story paper emphasizes understanding character motivation. Frame your story to explain why the character engaged in behaviors that negatively affected their mental health. What internal and external pressures shaped their actions? *   **Escalation and Consequence:** Similar to the immersive stories, you can build tension and highlight the impact of mental health issues. Detail how the problems progressed and eventually impacted the person's life. *   **Avoid Distractions:** The immersive story study also notes the need to design supporting characters appropriately. When sharing a story, be mindful of how secondary details might unintentionally distract the audience or lead them to justify the behavior being described. *   **Use Different Visuals:** The vlogging paper discusses different approaches.     *   **Anonymous:** Some individuals might benefit from anonymity to protect their identity.     *   **Talk-to-Camera:** This can create a direct and personal connection.     *   **In-the-Moment:** This method has potential to connect with the audience on an emotional level.  **3. Key Elements of Effective Storytelling for Mental Health:**  *   **The Setup (Context):** Introduce the character and their situation. Where are they? What's going on in their life? *   **The Trigger (Conflict):** Introduce the event or thought that triggered the mental health"

Use Personalized, Relatable Narratives**   - **Leverage AI-enhanced storytelling**: If possible, use LLMs to craft or adapt stories that reflect the audience’s unique struggles (e.g., anxiety, depression, or stigma). Personalized narratives can increase engagement and reduce resistance to key messages.   - **Balance realism and plausibility**: Ensure stories are relatable but not exaggerated—implausible scenarios may undermine credibility.    ### **2. Incorporate Authentic, Multimodal Storytelling**   - **Verbal + Visual Storytelling**: Like vloggers with schizophrenia, use a mix of **explicit emotional expressions** (e.g., ""I felt hopeless when..."") and **storytelling** (e.g., describing a turning point).   - **Framing techniques**: If using video or slides, vary presentation styles (e.g., direct ""talk-to-camera"" for intimacy, anonymous framing for broader relatability).    ### **3. Showcase Overcoming Struggles, Not Just Pain**   - **Highlight resilience**: Stories should illustrate **how** individuals applied psychological strategies (e.g., CBT techniques, social support) to cope.   - **Escalate consequences before resolution**: Like immersive health stories, show the progression of struggles before the recovery moment—this helps the audience ""experience"" the journey.    ### **4. Avoid Distractions & Justification of Harmful Behaviors**   - **Be mindful of side characters**: If using case studies, ensure supporting roles don’t inadvertently normalize harmful behaviors (e.g., a friend downplaying depression).   - **Clarify motivations**: Explain why characters engage in behaviors (e.g., ""She isolated herself because she feared judgment"") to foster empathy.    ### **5. Optimize Emotional Appeal for Engagement**   - **Use visually compelling elements**: If presenting via video or slides, ensure production quality doesn’t overshadow authenticity—viewers engage more with polished yet genuine content.   - **Encourage reflection**: Pose questions like, ""Have you ever felt this way?"" to bridge the story and the audience’s experiences.    ### **6. Maintain Authenticity & Trust**   - **Share lived experiences**: If comfortable, incorporate personal or real-world stories (like vloggers) to build credibility.   - **Acknowledge diversity**: Not all struggles are the same—acknowledge varied experiences to avoid a ""one-size-fits-all"" tone.    ### **Key Takeaways for Speakers**   - **Personalization** (via AI or audience research) boosts relatability.   - **Multimodal storytelling** (verbal + visual) enhances emotional connection.   - **Structured narratives** (struggle → escalation → resolution) improve retention.   - **Authenticity** is critical—avoid overly polished or unrealistic portrayals.    By integrating these evidence-based techniques, a speaker can make mental health discussions more engaging, relatable, and impactful.

The prevalence of online hate speech has fueled horrific real-world hate-crime such as the mass-genocide of Rohingya Muslims, communal violence in Colombo and the recent massacre in the Pittsburgh synagogue. Consequently, It is imperative to understand the diffusion of such hateful content in an online setting. We conduct the first study that analyses the flow and dynamics of posts generated by hateful and non-hateful users on Gab (gab.com) over a massive dataset of 341K users and 21M posts. Our observations confirms that hateful content diffuse farther, wider and faster and have a greater outreach than those of non-hateful users. A deeper inspection into the profiles and network of hateful and non-hateful users reveals that the former are more influential, popular and cohesive. Thus, our research explores the interesting facets of diffusion dynamics of hateful users and broadens our understanding of hate speech in the online world.

Communication on social media platforms is not only culturally and politically relevant, it is also increasingly widespread across societies. Users not only communicate via social media platforms, but also search specifically for information, disseminate it or post information themselves. However, fake news, hate speech and even radicalizing elements are part of this modern form of communication: Sometimes with far-reaching effects on individuals and societies. A basic understanding of these mechanisms and communication patterns could help to counteract negative forms of communication, e.g. bullying among children or extreme political points of view. To this end, a method will be presented in order to break down the underlying communication patterns, to trace individual users and to inspect their comments and range on social media platforms; Or to contrast them later on via qualitative research. This approeach can identify particularly active users with an accuracy of 100 percent, if the framing social networks as well as the topics are taken into account. However, methodological as well as counteracting approaches must be even more dynamic and flexible to ensure sensitivity and specifity regarding users who spread hate speech, fake news and radicalizing elements.

These users can then be flagged for closer monitoring.  5. **Community Guidelines**: Clear and consistent community guidelines are essential for managing hate speech. These guidelines should be easily accessible to users and enforced consistently.  6. **Education and Awareness**: Social media platforms can also educate users about the consequences of posting hateful content and the importance of respectful communication. This can help to reduce the amount of hate speech on the platform.  7. **Collaboration**: Social media platforms can collaborate with researchers, NGOs, and government agencies to better understand and address the issue of hate speech. This can help to develop more effective strategies for detecting and mitigating hate speech.  8. **User Reporting**: Encourage users to report hate speech. This can help to flag potentially hateful content for review and can also provide valuable data for improving content moderation tools.  9. **Transparency**: Social media platforms should be transparent about their efforts to combat hate speech. This can help to build trust with users and demonstrate a commitment to addressing the issue.  10. **Policy Enforcement**: Social media platforms should enforce their policies consistently and without bias. This can help to ensure that all users are treated fairly and that hate speech is not tolerated."

The rapid integration of the Internet into our daily lives has led to many benefits but also to a number of new, wide-spread threats such as online hate, trolling, bullying, and generally aggressive behaviours. While research has traditionally explored online hate, in particular, on one platform, the reality is that such hate is a phenomenon that often makes use of multiple online networks. In this article, we seek to advance the discussion into online hate by harnessing a comparative approach, where we make use of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to computationally analyse hateful content from Reddit and 4chan relating to the 2020 US Presidential Elections. Our findings show how content and posting activity can differ depending on the platform being used. Through this, we provide initial comparison into the platform-specific behaviours of online hate, and how different platforms can serve specific purposes. We further provide several avenues for future research utilising a cross-platform approach so as to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the global hate ecosystem.",17.632136821746826,"Social media platforms can detect and mitigate the spread of hateful content through a combination of **automated tools, human moderation, policy enforcement, and user education**. Below are key strategies based on research and industry practices:  ### **1. Automated Detection Using AI & NLP**   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models:**     - Supervised machine learning models trained on labeled datasets can classify hate speech based on keywords, sentiment, and context.     - Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) improve accuracy by understanding nuanced language.   - **Cross-Platform Analysis:**     - Comparing hate speech patterns across platforms (e.g., Gab, Reddit, 4chan) helps identify migration of hate communities.   - **Network Analysis:**     - Detecting influential hate spreaders by analyzing user engagement (likes, shares, replies) and network cohesion (echo chambers).    ### **2. Human Moderation & Crowdsourcing**   - **Hybrid Human-AI Review:**     - AI flags suspicious content, but human moderators make final decisions to reduce false positives/negatives.   - **User Reporting Systems:**     - Encouraging users to report hate speech helps platforms identify new trends.   - **Trust & Safety Teams:**     - Dedicated teams review flagged content and enforce policies consistently.    ### **3. Policy & Algorithmic Interventions**   - **Strict Community Guidelines:**     - Clear definitions of hate speech, with consequences (e.g., warnings, bans, shadow-banning).   - **Reducing Virality of Hateful Content:**     - Algorithmic demotion of posts from hateful users (limiting reach).     - Slowing down resharing of flagged content (e.g., Twitter’s ""read before retweet"" prompt).   - **Deplatforming & Account Suspensions:**     - Removing influential hate actors (e.g., banning extremist figures).    ### **4. Counter-Speech & Positive Reinforcement**   - **Promoting Counter-Narratives:**     - Amplifying voices that debunk hate speech (e.g., NGOs, fact-checkers).   - **User Education & Digital Literacy:**     - Teaching users to recognize and resist hate speech (e.g., Facebook’s ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign).    ### **5. Cross-Platform Collaboration & Research**   - **Data Sharing Between Platforms:**     - Identifying hate networks that migrate from one platform to another (e.g., from Gab to Telegram).   - **Academic & Industry Partnerships:**     - Supporting research on hate speech diffusion (like your study on Gab) to improve detection models.    ### **Challenges & Future Directions**   - **Evolving Language & Coded Hate Speech:**     - Hate groups adapt by using memes, dog whistles, and slang (requiring continuous model updates).   - **Balancing Free Speech & Moderation:**     - Over-censorship risks backlash, while under-moderation enables harm.   - **Global & Cultural Nuances:**     - Hate speech definitions vary by region (e.g., blasphemy laws vs. free speech protections).    ### **Conclusion**   Your research on Gab highlights how hateful content spreads faster and wider, emphasizing the need for **proactive detection, network-based interventions, and cross-platform strategies**. Combining **AI, human oversight,"

As a result, social media data has become a valuable resource for comprehending public sentiments. Studies have shown that it can amplify ideas and influence public sentiments. This study analyzes the public perception of climate change and the environment over a decade from 2014 to 2023. Using the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) algorithm, we identify sentiment and explore prevailing emotions expressed within environmental tweets across various social media platforms, namely Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. Accuracy on a human-annotated dataset was 0.65, higher than Vader score but lower than that of an expert rater (0.90). Our findings suggest that negative environmental tweets are far more common than positive or neutral ones. Climate change, air quality, emissions, plastic, and recycling are the most discussed topics on all social media platforms, highlighting its huge global concern. The most common emotions in environmental tweets are fear, trust, and anticipation, demonstrating public reactions wide and complex nature. By identifying patterns and trends in opinions related to the environment, we hope to provide insights that can help raise awareness regarding environmental issues, inform the development of interventions, and adapt further actions to meet environmental challenges.

10,llama_rag,What emotional tone inspires action in social issue posts?,"Social media platforms have emerged as prominent information sharing ecosystems in the context of a variety of recent crises, ranging from mass emergencies, to wars and political conflicts. We study affective responses in social media and how they might indicate desensitization to violence experienced in communities embroiled in an armed conflict. Specifically, we examine three established affect measures: negative affect, activation, and dominance as observed on Twitter in relation to a number of statistics on protracted violence in four major cities afflicted by the Mexican Drug War. During a two year period (Aug 2010-Dec 2012), while violence was on the rise in these regions, our findings show a decline in negative emotional expression as well as a rise in emotional arousal and dominance in Twitter posts: aspects known to be psychological markers of desensitization. We discuss the implications of our work for behavioral health, facilitating rehabilitation efforts in communities enmeshed in an acute and persistent urban warfare, and the impact on civic engagement.

Emotions play an important role in interpersonal interactions and social conflict, yet their function in the development of controversy and disagreement in online conversations has not been explored. To address this gap, we study controversy on Reddit, a popular network of online discussion forums. We collect discussions from a wide variety of topical forums and use emotion detection to recognize a range of emotions from text, including anger, fear, joy, admiration, etc. Our study has three main findings. First, controversial comments express more anger and less admiration, joy and optimism than non-controversial comments. Second, controversial comments affect emotions of downstream comments in a discussion, usually resulting in long-term increase in anger and a decrease in positive emotions, although the magnitude and direction of emotional change depends on the forum. Finally, we show that emotions help better predict which comments will become controversial. Understanding emotional dynamics of online discussions can help communities to better manage conversations.

Recent decades have witnessed online social media being a big-data window for quantificationally testifying conventional social theories and exploring much detailed human behavioral patterns. In this paper, by tracing the emoticon use in Weibo, a group of hidden ""ambivalent users"" are disclosed for frequently posting ambivalent tweets containing both positive and negative emotions. Further investigation reveals that this ambivalent expression could be a novel indicator of many unusual social behaviors. For instance, ambivalent users with the female as the majority like to make a sound in midnights or at weekends. They mention their close friends frequently in ambivalent tweets, which attract more replies and thus serve as a more private communication way. Ambivalent users also respond differently to public affairs from others and demonstrate more interests in entertainment and sports events. Moreover, the sentiment shift of words adopted in ambivalent tweets is more evident than usual and exhibits a clear ""negative to positive"" pattern. The above observations, though being promiscuous seemingly, actually point to the self regulation of negative mood in Weibo, which could find its base from the emotion management theories in sociology but makes an interesting extension to the online environment. Finally, as an interesting corollary, ambivalent users are found connected with compulsive buyers and turn out to be perfect targets for online marketing.",4.935910940170288,"The three studies you mentioned analyzed the emotional tone of social media posts in different contexts. To determine the emotional tone that inspires action in social issue posts, let's examine the findings of these studies.  1. The first study on Twitter posts during the Mexican Drug War found that as violence escalated, negative emotional expression decreased, while emotional arousal and dominance increased. This suggests that in the context of prolonged violence, people may become desensitized to the violence, and their emotional tone shifts towards a more assertive or dominant tone.  2. The second study on Reddit discussions found that controversy is associated with increased anger and decreased positive emotions like admiration, joy, and optimism. Moreover, the emotional tone of a comment can influence the emotions expressed in subsequent comments. This implies that in online discussions, a tone of anger or frustration can inspire further engagement and potentially action.  3. The third study on Weibo users found that ""ambivalent users"" who expressed both positive and negative emotions in their posts exhibited unique behaviors, such as self-regulation of negative mood and a tendency to engage in private communication. This ambivalence can be seen as a nuanced emotional tone that may inspire action in certain contexts, like online marketing.  Considering these findings, it appears that the emotional tone that inspires action in social issue posts is complex and context-dependent. However, some common themes emerge:  * A tone of assertiveness or dominance (as seen in the Twitter study) can be associated with increased civic engagement and potentially inspire action. * Anger or frustration (as seen in the Reddit study) can be a catalyst for further discussion and engagement, potentially leading to action. * Ambivalence or a mix of positive and negative emotions (as seen in the Weibo study) can be an indicator of nuanced emotional expression and potentially inspire action in specific contexts.  Overall, the emotional tone that inspires action in social issue posts is likely to be context-dependent and influenced by the specific issue, audience, and platform. A tone that is assertive, yet nuanced, and potentially emotive (e.g., anger or frustration) may be more likely to inspire action."

In the study you provided, it was found that negative emotional expression declined while emotional arousal and dominance increased on Twitter during a period of rising violence in four major cities afflicted by the Mexican Drug War. This suggests that people may have become desensitized to the violence, which could potentially reduce their motivation to take action.  On the other hand, in the study of controversy on Reddit, it was found that controversial comments express more anger and less admiration, joy, and optimism than non-controversial comments. This suggests that strong negative emotions, particularly anger, can drive controversy and potentially inspire action.  In both cases, it's clear that emotions play a significant role in shaping online conversations and motivating people to take action on social issues. Understanding these emotional dynamics can help communities to better manage conversations and facilitate civic engagement."
10,gemini_rag,What emotional tone inspires action in social issue posts?,"Social media platforms have emerged as prominent information sharing ecosystems in the context of a variety of recent crises, ranging from mass emergencies, to wars and political conflicts. We study affective responses in social media and how they might indicate desensitization to violence experienced in communities embroiled in an armed conflict. Specifically, we examine three established affect measures: negative affect, activation, and dominance as observed on Twitter in relation to a number of statistics on protracted violence in four major cities afflicted by the Mexican Drug War. During a two year period (Aug 2010-Dec 2012), while violence was on the rise in these regions, our findings show a decline in negative emotional expression as well as a rise in emotional arousal and dominance in Twitter posts: aspects known to be psychological markers of desensitization. We discuss the implications of our work for behavioral health, facilitating rehabilitation efforts in communities enmeshed in an acute and persistent urban warfare, and the impact on civic engagement.

Emotions play an important role in interpersonal interactions and social conflict, yet their function in the development of controversy and disagreement in online conversations has not been explored. To address this gap, we study controversy on Reddit, a popular network of online discussion forums. We collect discussions from a wide variety of topical forums and use emotion detection to recognize a range of emotions from text, including anger, fear, joy, admiration, etc. Our study has three main findings. First, controversial comments express more anger and less admiration, joy and optimism than non-controversial comments. Second, controversial comments affect emotions of downstream comments in a discussion, usually resulting in long-term increase in anger and a decrease in positive emotions, although the magnitude and direction of emotional change depends on the forum. Finally, we show that emotions help better predict which comments will become controversial. Understanding emotional dynamics of online discussions can help communities to better manage conversations.

Recent decades have witnessed online social media being a big-data window for quantificationally testifying conventional social theories and exploring much detailed human behavioral patterns. In this paper, by tracing the emoticon use in Weibo, a group of hidden ""ambivalent users"" are disclosed for frequently posting ambivalent tweets containing both positive and negative emotions. Further investigation reveals that this ambivalent expression could be a novel indicator of many unusual social behaviors. For instance, ambivalent users with the female as the majority like to make a sound in midnights or at weekends. They mention their close friends frequently in ambivalent tweets, which attract more replies and thus serve as a more private communication way. Ambivalent users also respond differently to public affairs from others and demonstrate more interests in entertainment and sports events. Moreover, the sentiment shift of words adopted in ambivalent tweets is more evident than usual and exhibits a clear ""negative to positive"" pattern. The above observations, though being promiscuous seemingly, actually point to the self regulation of negative mood in Weibo, which could find its base from the emotion management theories in sociology but makes an interesting extension to the online environment. Finally, as an interesting corollary, ambivalent users are found connected with compulsive buyers and turn out to be perfect targets for online marketing.",3.203608751296997,"Based on the provided text, here's a breakdown of the emotional tone that likely inspires action in social issue posts:  While the texts don't explicitly state which emotional tone *inspires* action, they provide clues and insights into how different emotions function in online interactions:  *   **Focus on Negative Emotions in Controversial Content:** The research on Reddit discussions highlights that controversial content often expresses **anger**, which, by its nature, can motivate action. The emotional tone in the posts is more about the conflict and the emotions that come up during the conflict. *   **Desensitization and the Decline of Negative Emotions:** The study of Twitter during the Mexican Drug War notes a decline in negative emotional expression alongside rising violence. This suggests that *simply expressing negative emotions like fear or sadness alone may not be enough to sustain action*. The study mentions the rise of emotional arousal and dominance, which may come from the conflict, but not necessarily indicate action. *   **Ambivalent Users and Self-Regulation:** The Weibo study on ambivalent users shows that they frequently mix positive and negative emotions. This could indicate a self-regulation strategy, but not necessarily the kind that inspires immediate action. However, the study does suggest that ambivalent users are more interested in certain social issues.  **Inferences about inspiring action:**  While the papers do not give a definite answer, the most likely tones that inspire action are:  *   **Anger:** It's the key emotion present in controversial content, which is often what social issue posts can become. *   **Hope:** While not mentioned in the above studies, hope could inspire action. People may be moved to work for a positive change. *   **Fear:** Fear of the consequences that social issues bring up may also move people to action.  The best answer is dependent on the issue at hand, since all emotional tones can inspire action. "

High-Arousal Emotions Drive Engagement**   - **Anger** is strongly linked to controversy and prolonged discussion (as seen in Reddit studies), making it effective for mobilizing attention around injustices or urgent issues.   - **Activation/Arousal** (e.g., urgency, fear, or excitement) correlates with desensitization in violent conflicts (Mexican Drug War study) but can also spur short-term action in advocacy campaigns.    ### **2. Mixed or Ambivalent Emotions Foster Deeper Interaction**   - **Ambivalent posts** (mixing positive and negative emotions, as in Weibo) attract more replies and private engagement, suggesting they create space for nuanced discussions or personal connections.   - These posts often involve **self-regulation** (e.g., shifting from negative to positive tone), which may encourage supportive responses.    ### **3. Dominance and Certainty Can Sustain Movements**   - In the Mexican Drug War study, rising **dominance** (confidence, control) in tweets coincided with prolonged violence, implying that assertive language may reinforce resilience or collective identity in crises.    ### **4. Positive Emotions Build Community but May Avoid Controversy**   - **Admiration, joy, and optimism** are linked to **less controversy** (Reddit study), making them better for unifying audiences rather than provoking immediate action.    ### **Practical Implications for Advocacy Posts:**   - **For rapid mobilization:** Use **anger or high-arousal negativity** (e.g., outrage at injustice).   - **For sustained engagement:** Blend **ambivalence** (e.g., hope + frustration) or **dominance** (e.g., ""We *will* change this"").   - **For community-building:** Leverage **admiration or collective joy** (e.g., celebrating small wins).

12,llama_rag,What are the best strategies for creating engaging content on Twitter for a tech company?,"140 characters seems like too small a space for any meaningful information to be exchanged, but Twitter users have found creative ways to get the most out of each Tweet by using different communication tools. This paper looks into how 73 nonprofit organizations use Twitter to engage stakeholders not only through their tweets, but also through other various communication methods. Specifically, it looks into the organizations' utilization of tweet frequency, following behavior, hyperlinks, hashtags, public messages, retweets, and multimedia files. After analyzing 4,655 tweets, the study found that the nation's largest nonprofits are not using Twitter to maximize stakeholder involvement. Instead, they continue to use social media as a one-way communication channel, as less than 20% of their total tweets demonstrate conversations and roughly 16% demonstrate indirect connections to specific users.

Twitter is a micro-blogging social media platform for short messages that can have a long-term impact on how scientists create and publish ideas. We investigate the usefulness of twitter in the development and distribution of scientific knowledge. At the start of the life cycle of a scientific publication, twitter provides a large virtual department of colleagues that can help to rapidly generate, share and refine new ideas. As ideas become manuscripts, twitter can be used as an informal arena for the pre-review of works in progress. Finally, tweeting published findings can communicate research to a broad audience of other researchers, decision makers, journalists and the general public that can amplify the scientific and social impact of publications. However, there are limitations, largely surrounding issues of intellectual property and ownership, inclusiveness and misrepresentations of science sound bites. Nevertheless, we believe twitter is a useful social media tool that can provide a valuable contribution to scientific publishing in the 21st century.

Collecting good ideas is vital for organizations, especially companies, to retain their competitiveness. Social media is gathering attention as a place to extract ideas efficiently; however, the characteristics of ideas and the posters of ideas on social media are underexamined. Thus, this study aims to characterize spontaneous ideation contests among social media users by taking an event of Facebook's name change to Meta as a case study. As a dataset, we comprehensively collect tweets containing new acronyms of Big Tech companies, which we treat as an ""idea"" in this work. In the analysis, we especially focus on the diversity of ideas, which would be the main reason for enlisting social media for idea generation. As the main results, we discovered that social media users offered a wider range of ideas than those in mainstream media. The follow-follower network of the users suggested that the users' position on the network is related to the preferred ideas. Additionally, we discovered a link between the amount of user interaction on social media and the diversity of ideas. This study would promote the use of social media as a part of open innovation and co-creation processes in the industry.",5.892283916473389,"## Strategies for Creating Engaging Content on Twitter for a Tech Company  To create engaging content on Twitter for a tech company, it's essential to understand the platform's unique characteristics and leverage various communication tools.

This paper looks into how 73 nonprofit organizations use Twitter to engage stakeholders not only through their tweets, but also through other various communication methods. Specifically, it looks into the organizations' utilization of tweet frequency, following behavior, hyperlinks, hashtags, public messages, retweets, and multimedia files. After analyzing 4,655 tweets, the study found that the nation's largest nonprofits are not using Twitter to maximize stakeholder involvement. Instead, they continue to use social media as a one-way communication channel, as less than 20% of their total tweets demonstrate conversations and roughly 16% demonstrate indirect connections to specific users.

Twitter is a micro-blogging social media platform for short messages that can have a long-term impact on how scientists create and publish ideas. We investigate the usefulness of twitter in the development and distribution of scientific knowledge. At the start of the life cycle of a scientific publication, twitter provides a large virtual department of colleagues that can help to rapidly generate, share and refine new ideas. As ideas become manuscripts, twitter can be used as an informal arena for the pre-review of works in progress. Finally, tweeting published findings can communicate research to a broad audience of other researchers, decision makers, journalists and the general public that can amplify the scientific and social impact of publications. However, there are limitations, largely surrounding issues of intellectual property and ownership, inclusiveness and misrepresentations of science sound bites. Nevertheless, we believe twitter is a useful social media tool that can provide a valuable contribution to scientific publishing in the 21st century.

13,llama_rag,How can a small business effectively build a loyal customer base?,"Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are very common in large companies. However, CRM systems are not very common in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Most SMEs do not implement CRM systems due to several reasons, such as lack of knowledge about CRM or lack of financial resources to implement CRM systems. SMEs have to start implementing Information Systems (IS) technology into their business operations in order to improve business values and gain more competitive advantage over rivals. CRM system has the potential to help improve the business value and competitive capabilities of SMEs. Given the high fixed costs of normal activity of companies, we intend to promote free and viable solutions for small and medium businesses. In this paper, we explain the reasons why SMEs do not implement CRM system and the benefits of using open source CRM system in SMEs. We also describe the functionalities of top open source CRM systems, examining the applicability of these tools in fitting the needs of SMEs.

Considering a supply chain with partial vertical integration, we attempt to seek answers to several questions related to the cooperation competition based friction, abundant in such networks. Such an SC can represent a supplier with an inhouse production unit that attempts to control an outhouse production unit via the said friction. The two production units can have different sets of loyal customer bases and the aim of the manufacturer supplier duo would be to get the best out of the two customer bases. Our analysis shows that under certain market conditions, an optimal strategy might be to allow both units to earn positive profits particularly when they hold similar market power and when customer loyalty is high. In cases of weaker customer loyalty, however, the optimal approach may involve pressurizing the outhouse unit to operate at minimal profits. Even more intriguing is the scenario where the outhouse unit has a greater market power and customer loyalty remains strong here, it may be optimal for the inhouse unit to operate at a loss just enough to dismantle the downstream monopoly.

This study tries to examine the influence of salesperson's customer orientation on customer loyalty. Customer orientation is the approach taken by a salesperson to improve customer relationship and increase sales. Many organizations prefer sales orientation as a strategic approach towards increasing sales. Though successful in its objective, sales orientation fails to attract repetitive purchase. It has become a necessity to train frontline employees to better understand the customer needs, keeping in mind the firm's ultimate objective.

Understanding customer preferences and tailoring the product offerings accordingly is key.  5. **Manage Operational Aspects**: Factors such as long lines of customers can negatively impact customer loyalty. Efficient management of operational aspects, such as reducing wait times, can improve customer satisfaction.  6. **Understand Customer Demographics**: Understanding customer demographics, such as annual income, can help in tailoring marketing strategies and product offerings to meet the specific needs of the customer base.  7. **Balance Cooperation and Competition**: For businesses with partial vertical integration (e.g., a supplier with both in-house and out-house production units), finding an optimal balance between cooperation and competition between different units can help in maximizing the value from different customer bases. This might involve strategies such as allowing both units to operate profitably if they have similar market power and strong customer loyalty.

Implement Open Source CRM Systems: Open source CRM systems can be a cost-effective solution for SMEs. These systems help manage customer interactions, track sales, and improve customer service. Some popular open source CRM systems include SugarCRM, vTiger CRM, and SuiteCRM.  2. Focus on Customer Orientation: Encourage your sales team to adopt a customer-oriented approach. This means understanding and meeting customer needs, providing excellent customer service, and building strong relationships with customers. Research shows that customer orientation can significantly increase customer loyalty.  3. Offer a Wide Product Assortment: Offering a wide variety of products can attract and retain customers. This strategy is particularly effective for businesses that sell non-essential items, such as clothing or electronics.  4. Manage Customer Expectations: Long lines of customers can lead to dissatisfaction and decreased customer loyalty. To manage customer expectations, consider implementing strategies such as appointment scheduling, online ordering, or offering self-service options.  5. Cater to High-Income Customers: High-income customers tend to be more loyal and spend more money. To attract and retain these customers, consider offering premium products or services, personalized service, and special promotions.  6. Improve Listening Skills: Active listening is a key component of customer orientation. Encourage your sales team to listen carefully to customer concerns, questions, and feedback. This can help build trust and strengthen customer relationships.  7. Leverage Partial Vertical Integration: In a supply chain with partial vertical integration, consider strategies that allow both in-house and outsourced production units to earn positive profits. This can be achieved by allowing each unit to operate independently while coordinating efforts to serve customers effectively.  8. Analyze Market Conditions: Understanding market conditions can help you make informed decisions about how to best serve your customers. For example, if customer loyalty is high, consider strategies that allow both production units to earn positive profits. If customer loyalty is weak, you may need to take steps to improve customer service or offer more competitive pricing.  9. Monitor and Adjust Strategies: Regularly monitor customer satisfaction, sales, and other key performance indicators. Use this data to adjust your strategies as needed to maintain a loyal customer base.  10. Foster a Customer-Centric Culture: Encourage a customer-centric culture within your organization. This means prioritizing customer needs and expectations, and making decisions that benefit customers in the long run. A customer-centric culture can help attract and retain loyal customers."

Leverage Free or Low-Cost CRM Solutions** Since many SMEs avoid CRM systems due to cost or complexity, **open-source or freemium CRM tools** (e.g., SuiteCRM, HubSpot CRM, Zoho CRM) can help: - **Track customer interactions** (purchases, preferences, complaints). - **Automate follow-ups** (birthday discounts, post-purchase feedback requests). - **Segment customers** for targeted promotions (e.g., loyal vs. occasional buyers).  **Actionable Tip**: Start with a simple spreadsheet if CRM adoption is daunting, then migrate to free tools as your business grows.  ---  ### **2. Prioritize Customer Orientation Over Sales Push** Research shows that **customer-oriented salespeople** (who listen and solve problems) drive loyalty better than aggressive sales tactics. SMEs can: - **Train employees** to ask questions, understand needs, and recommend solutions. - **Reward repeat purchases** (e.g., loyalty points) instead of one-time discounts. - **Use feedback loops** (surveys, social media polls) to refine offerings.  **Example**: A local bakery could remember regular customers’ favorite orders and suggest complementary items.  ---  ### **3. Build Trust Through Transparency** - **Honest communication** about pricing, product sourcing, or delays. - **Share behind-the-scenes stories** (e.g., ""Meet the Artisan"" social media posts). - **Resolve complaints publicly and promptly** to show accountability.  ---  ### **4. Foster Community Engagement** - **Host local events** (workshops, pop-ups) to connect face-to-face. - **Collaborate with other SMEs** (e.g., cross-promotions with non-competing businesses). - **Leverage user-generated content** (e.g., reposting customer photos with your product).  ---  ### **5. Optimize Supply Chain Relationships** For SMEs with partial vertical integration (e.g., in-house + outsourced production): - **Balance cooperation and competition** between units. If both have loyal customers, avoid undercutting either. - **Use customer loyalty data** to allocate resources (e.g., prioritize high-loyalty segments).  **Case Example**: A small clothing brand might use in-house production for custom orders (high loyalty) and outsource bulk basics (price-sensitive buyers).  ---  ### **6. Personalize the Experience** - **Handwritten thank-you notes** with orders. - **Exclusive perks** for repeat buyers (early access to sales, free samples). - **AI-driven recommendations** (if using e-commerce; e.g., ""Customers who bought X also liked Y"").  ---  ### **7. Measure and Adapt** - **Track key metrics**: Repeat purchase rate, Net Promoter Score (NPS), referral traffic. - **A/B test strategies**: Compare loyalty program designs or email campaign styles.  ---  ### **Why This Works for SMEs** - **Low-cost**: Many strategies (CRM tools, community events) require minimal investment. - **Scalable**: Start small (e.g., 10 loyal customers) and expand as revenue grows. - **Differentiation**: Builds emotional connections that big corporations often lack.

Excitement for a quiet evening with a good book.

Finding enjoyable fiction books can be challenging, partly because stories are multi-faceted and one's own literary taste might be difficult to ascertain. Here, we introduce the ISAAC method (Introspection-Support, AI-Annotation, and Curation), a pipeline which supports fiction readers in gaining awareness of their literary preferences and finding enjoyable books. ISAAC consists of four steps: a user supplies book ratings, an AI agent researches and annotates the provided books, patterns in book enjoyment are reviewed by the user, and the AI agent recommends new books. In this proof-of-concept self-study, the authors test whether ISAAC can highlight idiosyncratic patterns in their book enjoyment, spark a deeper reflection about their literary tastes, and make accurate, personalized recommendations of enjoyable books and underexplored literary niches. Results highlight substantial advantages of ISAAC over existing methods such as an integration of automation and intuition, accurate and customizable annotations, and explainable book recommendations. Observed disadvantages are that ISAAC's outputs can elicit false self-narratives (if statistical patterns are taken at face value), that books cannot be annotated if their online documentation is lacking, and that people who are new to reading have to rely on assumed book ratings or movie ratings to power the ISAAC pipeline. We discuss additional opportunities of ISAAC-style book annotations for the study of literary trends, and the scientific classification of books and readers.",6.03161096572876,"To share enthusiasm for a new book release, consider the following ideas:  1. **Social Media Posts**: Share your excitement on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. You can post a photo of the book, a quote from it, or simply express your eagerness to dive into it. Use relevant hashtags to connect with other fans or readers.     Example: ""Just got my hands on the latest release from my favorite author! Can't wait to get lost in this new story. #NewBookAlert #BookLovers #FavoriteAuthor""  2. **Book Clubs or Reading Groups**: If you're part of a book club or reading group, announce the new release and suggest it as a potential next read. This can generate discussion and shared excitement among members.  3. **Online Book Communities**: Websites like Goodreads, Reddit (r/books or author-specific subreddits), or dedicated book forums are great places to share your enthusiasm. You can post a review, start a discussion thread about the book, or simply share your anticipation.  4. **Personal Blog or YouTube Channel**: If you have a blog or YouTube channel focused on books or reading, you can write a post or create a video discussing the new release. Share your thoughts on why you're excited, what you hope to get out of the book, or your initial impressions.  5. **Recommend to Friends and Family**: Sometimes, the simplest way to share your enthusiasm is directly with people you know. Recommend the book to friends or family members who might enjoy it, explaining why you're so excited about it.  6. **Create Content Around the Book**: For a more elaborate expression of enthusiasm, you could create fan art, write fan fiction related to the book's universe (if appropriate), or even cosplay characters from the book if it's part of a series you're deeply invested in.  7. **Pre-order or Buy Ahead**: Show your support by pre-ordering the book or buying it as soon as it's released. Some platforms allow you to mark a book as ""pre-ordered"" or ""wishlist"" which can be shared with friends or online communities.  8. **Discuss with the Author (if possible)**: If there's an opportunity to interact with the author through social media, at a book signing, or via email, express your excitement directly to them. Authors often appreciate hearing from enthusiastic readers.  The passage you've included about the ISAAC method, while interesting, seems unrelated to your initial statement about a new book release from your favorite author. However, it does touch on the broader topic of discovering new books and understanding personal literary preferences, which could be a related interest if you're looking to explore more books beyond your favorite author's latest release."

The PizzaBox has gone through both low and medium fidelity testing while working collaboratively with participants to co-design and refine a product that is approachable to all age groups while maintaining a simple process for ordering food from start to finish. Final testing was conducted at an independent pizzeria where interviews with participants lead us to develop four discussion themes 1) usability and end user engagement, 2) towards connected real-time products and services, 3) healthy eating, 4) evolution of food ordering systems. Our interviews show that in general, PizzaBox would have a greater appeal to a younger audience by providing a fantasy of helping in the creation and baking of the pizza but also has a novelty value that all ages would enjoy. We investigate the effect that the PizzaBox has in encouraging new healthy habits or promoting a healthier lifestyle as well as how we can improve PizzaBox to better encourage these lifestyle changes.

Climate change education often struggles to bridge the perception gap between everyday actions and their long-term environmental consequences. In response, we developed Meltdown, an immersive virtual reality (VR) escape room that simulates a grocery shopping and food waste management experience to educate university students in Singapore about sustainable consumption. The game emphasizes sustainable food choices and disposal practices, combining interactive elements and narrative feedback to promote behavioral change. Through a user study with 36 university students, we observed statistically significant improvements in participants objective knowledge, perceived confidence, and intention to adopt sustainable behaviors. Our results suggest that experiential VR environments can enhance climate education by making abstract environmental concepts more immediate and personally relevant.

The recommendation of food items is important for many reasons. Attaining cooking inspiration via digital sources is becoming evermore popular; as are systems, which recommend other types of food, such as meals in restaurants or products in supermarkets. Researchers have been studying these kinds of systems for many years, suggesting not only that can they be a means to help people find food they might want to eat, but also help them nourish themselves more healthily. This paper provides a summary of the state-of-the-art of so-called food recommender systems, highlighting both seminal and most recent approaches to the problem, as well as important specializations, such as food recommendation systems for groups of users or systems which promote healthy eating. We moreover discuss the diverse challenges involved in designing recsys for food, summarise the lessons learned from past research and outline what we believe to be important future directions and open questions for the field. In providing these contributions we hope to provide a useful resource for researchers and practitioners alike.",5.788857698440552,"To promote a virtual cooking class and attract participants, a user can consider the following strategies:  1. **Social Media Campaigns**: Utilize platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to create engaging content (e.g., recipe teasers, cooking tips, behind-the-scenes class preparations) that showcases the virtual cooking class. Hashtags can be used to reach a wider audience interested in cooking.  2. **Influencer Collaborations**: Partner with food or cooking influencers who can promote the virtual cooking class to their followers.

This can help attract potential participants who are searching for cooking-related information online.  5. **Virtual Event Platforms**: List the virtual cooking class on platforms that host online events and workshops.

This can be a powerful way to demonstrate the value of the class.  7. **Community Building**: Create a community around the virtual cooking class, such as a Facebook group or forum, where participants can share their cooking experiences, ask questions, and interact with each other. This can help build a loyal following and encourage word-of-mouth promotion.  8. **Special Promotions and Discounts**: Offer limited-time discounts or special promotions to encourage sign-ups. This can be particularly effective for first-time participants or during holiday seasons.  9. **Testimonials and Reviews**: Encourage previous participants to share their experiences and feedback. Positive testimonials and reviews can be a strong motivator for others to join the class.  10. **Cross-Promotion**: If applicable, cross-promote the virtual cooking class with related businesses or services, such as kitchen supply stores or food delivery services, to reach a broader audience.  By implementing these strategies, a user can effectively promote a virtual cooking class and attract a significant number of participants."

Share engaging content, such as cooking demonstrations, behind-the-scenes looks, and participant testimonials. You could also collaborate with influencers or food bloggers to reach a wider audience.  6. **Offer incentives**: Consider offering incentives, such as discounts, freebies, or exclusive content, to encourage people to sign up for your cooking class.  7. **Provide a simple and user-friendly process**: Make it easy for people to sign up for your cooking class and participate. This could involve creating a user-friendly website, providing clear instructions, and offering multiple ways to sign up (e.g., email, social media, phone).  8. **Collect feedback and iterate**: After each cooking class, collect feedback from participants and use this to improve your classes. This will help you create a better experience for future participants and attract more people to your classes."

15,deepseek_rag,How can a user promote a virtual cooking class to attract participants?,"This paper presents the designing and testing of PizzaBox, a 3D printed, interactive food ordering system that aims to differ from conventional food ordering systems and provide an entertaining and unique experience when ordering a pizza by incorporating underlying technologies that support ubiquitous computing. The PizzaBox has gone through both low and medium fidelity testing while working collaboratively with participants to co-design and refine a product that is approachable to all age groups while maintaining a simple process for ordering food from start to finish. Final testing was conducted at an independent pizzeria where interviews with participants lead us to develop four discussion themes 1) usability and end user engagement, 2) towards connected real-time products and services, 3) healthy eating, 4) evolution of food ordering systems. Our interviews show that in general, PizzaBox would have a greater appeal to a younger audience by providing a fantasy of helping in the creation and baking of the pizza but also has a novelty value that all ages would enjoy. We investigate the effect that the PizzaBox has in encouraging new healthy habits or promoting a healthier lifestyle as well as how we can improve PizzaBox to better encourage these lifestyle changes.

Climate change education often struggles to bridge the perception gap between everyday actions and their long-term environmental consequences. In response, we developed Meltdown, an immersive virtual reality (VR) escape room that simulates a grocery shopping and food waste management experience to educate university students in Singapore about sustainable consumption. The game emphasizes sustainable food choices and disposal practices, combining interactive elements and narrative feedback to promote behavioral change. Through a user study with 36 university students, we observed statistically significant improvements in participants objective knowledge, perceived confidence, and intention to adopt sustainable behaviors. Our results suggest that experiential VR environments can enhance climate education by making abstract environmental concepts more immediate and personally relevant.

The recommendation of food items is important for many reasons. Attaining cooking inspiration via digital sources is becoming evermore popular; as are systems, which recommend other types of food, such as meals in restaurants or products in supermarkets. Researchers have been studying these kinds of systems for many years, suggesting not only that can they be a means to help people find food they might want to eat, but also help them nourish themselves more healthily. This paper provides a summary of the state-of-the-art of so-called food recommender systems, highlighting both seminal and most recent approaches to the problem, as well as important specializations, such as food recommendation systems for groups of users or systems which promote healthy eating. We moreover discuss the diverse challenges involved in designing recsys for food, summarise the lessons learned from past research and outline what we believe to be important future directions and open questions for the field. In providing these contributions we hope to provide a useful resource for researchers and practitioners alike.",21.689884901046753,"To promote a **virtual cooking class** and attract participants, you can leverage insights from the provided research papers while incorporating effective marketing strategies. Here’s a structured approach:  ### **1.

16,llama_rag,Why would a user hide their identity in a sensitive online discussion?,"In communities with social hierarchies, fear of judgment can discourage communication. While anonymity may alleviate some social pressure, fully anonymous spaces enable toxic behavior and hide the social context that motivates people to participate and helps them tailor their communication. We explore a design space of meronymous communication, where people can reveal carefully chosen aspects of their identity and also leverage trusted endorsers to gain credibility. We implemented these ideas in a system for scholars to meronymously seek and receive paper recommendations on Twitter and Mastodon. A formative study with 20 scholars confirmed that scholars see benefits to participating but are deterred due to social anxiety. From a month-long public deployment, we found that with meronymity, junior scholars could comfortably ask ``newbie'' questions and get responses from senior scholars who they normally found intimidating. Responses were also tailored to the aspects about themselves that junior scholars chose to reveal.

Social media platforms (SMPs) facilitate information sharing across varying levels of sensitivity. A crucial design decision for SMP administrators is the platform's identity policy, with some opting for real-name systems while others allow anonymous participation. Content moderation on these platforms is conducted by both humans and automated bots. This paper examines the relationship between anonymity, specifically through the use of ``throwaway'' accounts, and the extent and nature of content moderation on Reddit. Our findings indicate that content originating from anonymous throwaway accounts is more likely to violate rules on Reddit. Thus, they are more likely to be removed by moderation than standard pseudonymous accounts. However, the moderation actions applied to throwaway accounts are consistent with those applied to ordinary accounts, suggesting that the use of anonymous accounts does not necessarily necessitate increased human moderation. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for identity policies and content moderation strategies on SMPs.

Anonymity forms an integral and important part of our digital life. It enables us to express our true selves without the fear of judgment. In this paper, we investigate the different aspects of anonymity in the social Q&A site Quora. The choice of Quora is motivated by the fact that this is one of the rare social Q&A sites that allow users to explicitly post anonymous questions and such activity in this forum has become normative rather than a taboo. Through an analysis of 5.1 million questions, we observe that at a global scale almost no difference manifests between the linguistic structure of the anonymous and the non-anonymous questions. We find that topical mixing at the global scale to be the primary reason for the absence. However, the differences start to feature once we ""deep dive"" and (topically) cluster the questions and compare the clusters that have high volumes of anonymous questions with those that have low volumes of anonymous questions. In particular, we observe that the choice to post the question as anonymous is dependent on the user's perception of anonymity and they often choose to speak about depression, anxiety, social ties and personal issues under the guise of anonymity. We further perform personality trait analysis and observe that the anonymous group of users has positive correlation with extraversion, agreeableness, and negative correlation with openness. Subsequently, to gain further insights, we build an anonymity grid to identify the differences in the perception on anonymity of the user posting the question and the community of users answering it. We also look into the first response time of the questions and observe that it is lowest for topics which talk about personal and sensitive issues, which hints toward a higher degree of community support and user engagement.",5.4439709186553955,"A user may hide their identity in a sensitive online discussion for several reasons, primarily to avoid fear of judgment, social anxiety, or repercussions. The papers discussed highlight various aspects of anonymity and its implications on online interactions.  1. **Fear of Judgment and Social Anxiety**: In communities with established social hierarchies, individuals might be deterred from participating in discussions due to fear of being judged or evaluated based on their status, expertise, or personal characteristics. Anonymity or meronymity (a form of partial anonymity where some aspects of identity are revealed) can alleviate this fear, encouraging more open and honest communication.  2. **Sensitive Topics**: When discussing sensitive or personal issues such as depression, anxiety, or social ties, users may prefer to remain anonymous to protect their privacy and avoid potential stigma associated with these topics. The analysis on Quora questions revealed that users tend to post anonymously when discussing personal and sensitive issues.  3. **Toxic Behavior vs. Genuine Participation**: While complete anonymity can enable toxic behavior by removing accountability, it also allows for genuine participation from individuals who might otherwise be too intimidated to contribute. The study on meronymous communication suggests that revealing carefully chosen aspects of one's identity can help in gaining credibility and fostering a more constructive and supportive community.  4. **Content Moderation and Anonymity**: The relationship between anonymity and content moderation is complex. The study on Reddit found that content from anonymous ""throwaway"" accounts was more likely to violate community rules and be moderated. However, the moderation actions applied to these accounts were consistent with those for non-anonymous accounts, suggesting that anonymity doesn't necessarily require different moderation strategies.  5. **Perception of Anonymity and Community Support**: The perception of anonymity can vary between the user posting a question and the community responding to it. The Quora study introduced an ""anonymity grid"" to explore these differences. It also found that questions about personal and sensitive issues received quicker responses, indicating a high level of community support and engagement for such topics under the protection of anonymity.  In summary, users hide their identity in sensitive online discussions primarily to avoid judgment and social repercussions, allowing them to express themselves more freely, especially on personal or sensitive topics. The design of online platforms, including their identity policies and moderation strategies, plays a crucial role in balancing the benefits of anonymity with the need to maintain a respectful and constructive community."

Privacy and confidentiality: Users may want to protect their personal information, such as their name, location, or professional details, from being exposed to others. This is particularly important in discussions about personal or sensitive topics, such as health issues, financial problems, or legal matters.  2. Fear of judgment or discrimination: Users may feel uncomfortable sharing their opinions or experiences in a public forum due to the fear of being judged, ridiculed, or discriminated against based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or political beliefs. Anonymity can help them express themselves more freely without worrying about the potential consequences.  3. Social anxiety: Some users may experience social anxiety or shyness that prevents them from participating in online discussions. Anonymity can help alleviate these feelings and encourage them to engage in conversations they might otherwise avoid.  4. Protecting sources or maintaining confidentiality: In some cases, users may be sharing information that they have obtained from others, such as whistleblowers, sources, or victims of abuse. Anonymity can help protect the identity of these individuals and ensure their safety.  5. Avoiding professional repercussions: In professional settings, such as academic or business discussions, users may want to share their opinions or ask questions without revealing their identity to avoid potential repercussions, such as negative career implications or damage to their professional reputation.  6. Exploring controversial or unpopular opinions: Anonymity can provide a safe space for users to express opinions that may be controversial or unpopular without fear of backlash or harassment from others. This can foster more open and honest discussions, as users are less likely to self-censor their thoughts.  7. Protecting intellectual property: In creative communities, users may want to share their work or ideas without revealing their identity to protect their intellectual property rights and avoid plagiarism or theft.  8. Maintaining a separate online persona: Some users may choose to maintain multiple online identities for various reasons, such as separating personal and professional lives, exploring different interests, or engaging in activities that they would not want associated with their main online persona. Anonymity can help them manage these separate identities more effectively.  9. Protecting themselves from cyberbullying or harassment: Users may choose to remain anonymous to protect themselves from online harassment, cyberstalking, or doxxing, which can have serious consequences, such as emotional distress, loss of privacy, and even physical harm.  10. Ensuring fairness and impartiality: In some cases, users may choose to remain anonymous to ensure that their opinions or contributions are evaluated based on their content rather than their identity. This can help promote fairness and impartiality in discussions, particularly in areas such as journalism, academia, or activism."

17,llama_rag,What risks come from debating online without clear community guidelines?,"Online discussion moderators must make ad-hoc decisions about whether the contributions of discussion participants are appropriate or should be removed to maintain civility. Existing research on offensive language and the resulting tools cover only one aspect among many involved in such decisions. The question of what is considered appropriate in a controversial discussion has not yet been systematically addressed. In this paper, we operationalize appropriate language in argumentation for the first time. In particular, we model appropriateness through the absence of flaws, grounded in research on argument quality assessment, especially in aspects from rhetoric. From these, we derive a new taxonomy of 14 dimensions that determine inappropriate language in online discussions. Building on three argument quality corpora, we then create a corpus of 2191 arguments annotated for the 14 dimensions. Empirical analyses support that the taxonomy covers the concept of appropriateness comprehensively, showing several plausible correlations with argument quality dimensions. Moreover, results of baseline approaches to assessing appropriateness suggest that all dimensions can be modeled computationally on the corpus.

Online debates can enhance critical thinking but may escalate into hostile attacks. As humans are increasingly reliant on Generative AI (GenAI) in writing tasks, we need to understand how people utilize GenAI in online debates. To examine the patterns of writing behavior while making arguments with GenAI, we created an online forum for soccer fans to engage in turn-based and free debates in a post format with the assistance of ChatGPT, arguing on the topic of ""Messi vs Ronaldo"". After 13 sessions of two-part study and semi-structured interviews with 39 participants, we conducted content and thematic analyses to integrate insights from interview transcripts, ChatGPT records, and forum posts. We found that participants prompted ChatGPT for aggressive responses, created posts with similar content and logical fallacies, and sacrificed the use of ChatGPT for better human-human communication. This work uncovers how polarized forum members work with GenAI to engage in debates online.

Terms like 'misinformation', 'fake news', and 'echo chambers' permeate current discussions on the state of the Internet. We believe a lack of technological support to evaluate, contest, and reason about information online---as opposed to merely disseminating it---lies at the root of these problems. Several argument technologies support such functionality, but have seen limited use outside of niche communities. Most research systems overemphasize argument analysis and structure, standing in stark contrast with the informal dialectical nature of everyday argumentation. Conversely, non-academic systems overlook important implications for design which can be derived from theory. In this paper, we present the design of a system aiming to strike a balance between structured argumentation and ease of use. Socratrees is a website for collaborative argumentative discussion targeting layman users, but includes sophisticated community guidelines and novel features inspired by informal logic. During an exploratory study, we evaluate the usefulness of our imposed structure on argumentation and investigate how users perceive it. Contributing to arguments remains a complex task, but most users learned to do so effectively with minimal guidance and all recognized that the structure of Socratrees may improve online discussion and results in a clearer overview of arguments.",3.175628185272217,"The risks that come from debating online without clear community guidelines include:  1. **Escalation into hostile attacks**: Online debates can quickly turn into personal attacks and insults, creating a toxic environment. 2. **Spread of misinformation and fake news**: Without guidelines, online debates can spread false or misleading information, which can be difficult to correct. 3. **Echo chambers**: Online debates can become isolated and reinforce existing biases, rather than encouraging diverse perspectives and constructive discussion. 4. **Inappropriate language and behavior**: Without clear guidelines, online debaters may engage in abusive or inflammatory language, which can be hurtful or alienating to others. 5. **Polarization**: Online debates can become increasingly polarized, with participants becoming more entrenched in their views and less willing to engage with opposing perspectives. 6. **Manipulation by Generative AI**: The use of Generative AI (GenAI) in online debates can amplify these risks, as individuals may use AI to generate aggressive or misleading responses.  The absence of clear community guidelines can lead to a lack of accountability and a failure to maintain civility in online debates.

From these, we derive a new taxonomy of 14 dimensions that determine inappropriate language in online discussions. Building on three argument quality corpora, we then create a corpus of 2191 arguments annotated for the 14 dimensions. Empirical analyses support that the taxonomy covers the concept of appropriateness comprehensively, showing several plausible correlations with argument quality dimensions. Moreover, results of baseline approaches to assessing appropriateness suggest that all dimensions can be modeled computationally on the corpus.

Online debates can enhance critical thinking but may escalate into hostile attacks. As humans are increasingly reliant on Generative AI (GenAI) in writing tasks, we need to understand how people utilize GenAI in online debates. To examine the patterns of writing behavior while making arguments with GenAI, we created an online forum for soccer fans to engage in turn-based and free debates in a post format with the assistance of ChatGPT, arguing on the topic of ""Messi vs Ronaldo"". After 13 sessions of two-part study and semi-structured interviews with 39 participants, we conducted content and thematic analyses to integrate insights from interview transcripts, ChatGPT records, and forum posts. We found that participants prompted ChatGPT for aggressive responses, created posts with similar content and logical fallacies, and sacrificed the use of ChatGPT for better human-human communication. This work uncovers how polarized forum members work with GenAI to engage in debates online.

Terms like 'misinformation', 'fake news', and 'echo chambers' permeate current discussions on the state of the Internet. We believe a lack of technological support to evaluate, contest, and reason about information online---as opposed to merely disseminating it---lies at the root of these problems. Several argument technologies support such functionality, but have seen limited use outside of niche communities. Most research systems overemphasize argument analysis and structure, standing in stark contrast with the informal dialectical nature of everyday argumentation. Conversely, non-academic systems overlook important implications for design which can be derived from theory. In this paper, we present the design of a system aiming to strike a balance between structured argumentation and ease of use. Socratrees is a website for collaborative argumentative discussion targeting layman users, but includes sophisticated community guidelines and novel features inspired by informal logic. During an exploratory study, we evaluate the usefulness of our imposed structure on argumentation and investigate how users perceive it. Contributing to arguments remains a complex task, but most users learned to do so effectively with minimal guidance and all recognized that the structure of Socratrees may improve online discussion and results in a clearer overview of arguments.",3.2697560787200928," Debating online without clear community guidelines can lead to several risks:  1. Lack of civility and respect: Without clear guidelines, discussions can quickly devolve into hostile attacks, personal insults, and name-calling. This can create an unpleasant environment that discourages participation and fosters a toxic community.  2. Spread of misinformation and fake news: Without guidelines, it can be difficult to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information. This can lead to the spread of misinformation and the perpetuation of false beliefs.  3. Echo chambers and groupthink: Without guidelines that encourage diverse perspectives and open-mindedness, online discussions can become echo chambers where only certain viewpoints are allowed and alternative viewpoints are silenced. This can lead to groupthink and a lack of critical thinking.  4. Logical fallacies and poor argumentation: Without guidelines that promote clear and logical argumentation, discussions can be filled with logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, and other forms of poor argumentation. This can make it difficult to have productive and meaningful discussions.  5. Lack of accountability: Without clear guidelines and consequences for violating them, individuals may feel free to engage in inappropriate behavior without fear of repercussions. This can create a culture of impunity and make it difficult to maintain a civil and respectful community.  6. Misuse of AI: As AI becomes more prevalent in writing tasks, there is a risk that it will be used to create aggressive or inappropriate content in online debates. This can make it difficult to distinguish between human and AI-generated content and can create further challenges in maintaining a civil and respectful community.  7. Lack of structure and clarity: Without clear guidelines, it can be difficult to structure discussions effectively and to have a clear understanding of the arguments being presented. This can make it difficult to have productive and meaningful discussions and can lead to confusion and frustration.  8. Lack of transparency: Without clear guidelines, it can be difficult to understand the rules of the community and to know what is and is not allowed. This can create a lack of transparency and can make it difficult to hold individuals accountable for their actions.  Overall, debating online without clear community guidelines can lead to a variety of risks, including a lack of civility, the spread of misinformation, echo chambers, poor argumentation, a lack of accountability, misuse of AI, a lack of structure and clarity, and a lack of transparency. It is important for online communities to have clear and enforceable guidelines to help ensure that discussions are productive, respectful, and meaningful."

Based on the research excerpts provided, these risks include:    1. **Escalation into Hostility and Aggression**      - Without moderation, discussions can devolve into personal attacks, aggressive rhetoric, or trolling.      - Participants may prompt AI tools (like ChatGPT) to generate hostile responses, amplifying conflict rather than fostering constructive debate.    2. **Proliferation of Inappropriate Language and Logical Fallacies**      - Unstructured debates often suffer from flawed argumentation, including ad hominem attacks, strawman arguments, and other rhetorical fallacies.      - The absence of guidelines makes it harder to enforce civility or penalize manipulative tactics.    3. **Polarization and Echo Chambers**      - Without mechanisms to encourage balanced discourse, discussions may reinforce existing biases, leading to ideological silos.      - Misinformation and ""fake news"" thrive in environments where critical evaluation of arguments is lacking.    4. **Overreliance on AI-Generated Content Without Critical Engagement**      - Users may depend on AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to formulate arguments, leading to homogenized, low-quality, or fallacious reasoning.      - AI-generated responses may lack nuance, reinforcing groupthink rather than fostering original thought.    5. **Moderator Bias and Inconsistent Enforcement**      - Without clear guidelines, moderators must make subjective, ad-hoc decisions, leading to perceived (or actual) bias.      - This inconsistency can discourage participation from users who fear unfair treatment.    6. **Reduced Clarity and Constructiveness in Discussions**      - Unstructured debates often lack coherent organization, making it difficult for participants to follow or meaningfully engage with arguments.      - Systems like *Socratrees* suggest that structured argumentation improves discussion quality, but without guidelines, debates remain chaotic.    ### Solutions and Mitigations   The research highlights potential remedies:   - **Structured Argumentation Systems** (e.g., *Socratrees*) can guide users toward more logical, civil discourse.   - **Comprehensive Moderation Taxonomies** (e.g., the 14-dimension model of appropriateness) help standardize enforcement.   - **AI-Assisted Moderation** could flag inappropriate language or logical fallacies in real time.   - **Encouraging Human-Human Interaction** over AI reliance may improve authenticity and reduce hostility.    ### Conclusion   Without clear guidelines, online debates risk becoming toxic, polarized, and unproductive. Structured systems, AI moderation, and community-driven norms can help mitigate these risks while preserving the benefits of open discussion.

19,llama_rag,What are some creative ways to photograph food for an Instagram post?,"What we eat is one of the most frequent and important health decisions we make in daily life, yet it remains notoriously difficult to capture and understand. Effective food journaling is thus a grand challenge in personal health informatics. In this paper we describe a system for food journaling called I Ate This, which is inspired by the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM). I Ate This is simple: you use a smartphone app to take a photo and give a very basic description of any food or beverage you are about to consume. Later, a qualified dietitian will evaluate your photo, giving you feedback on how you did and where you can improve. The aim of I Ate This is to provide a convenient, visual and reliable way to help users learn from their eating habits and nudge them towards better choices each and every day. Ultimately, this incremental approach can lead to long-term behaviour change. Our goal is to bring RFPM to a wider audience, through APIs that can be incorporated into other apps.

The pervasiveness of mobile cameras has resulted in a dramatic increase in food photos, which are pictures reflecting what people eat. In this paper, we study how taking pictures of what we eat in restaurants can be used for the purpose of automating food journaling. We propose to leverage the context of where the picture was taken, with additional information about the restaurant, available online, coupled with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to recognize the food being consumed. To this end, we demonstrate image-based recognition of foods eaten in restaurants by training a classifier with images from restaurant's online menu databases. We evaluate the performance of our system in unconstrained, real-world settings with food images taken in 10 restaurants across 5 different types of food (American, Indian, Italian, Mexican and Thai).

People enjoy food photography because they appreciate food. Behind each meal there is a story described in a complex recipe and, unfortunately, by simply looking at a food image we do not have access to its preparation process. Therefore, in this paper we introduce an inverse cooking system that recreates cooking recipes given food images. Our system predicts ingredients as sets by means of a novel architecture, modeling their dependencies without imposing any order, and then generates cooking instructions by attending to both image and its inferred ingredients simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the whole system on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset and show that (1) we improve performance w.r.t. previous baselines for ingredient prediction; (2) we are able to obtain high quality recipes by leveraging both image and ingredients; (3) our system is able to produce more compelling recipes than retrieval-based approaches according to human judgment. We make code and models publicly available.",5.543973684310913,"## Creative Ways to Photograph Food for Instagram  To capture visually appealing food images for Instagram, consider the following creative techniques:  ### 1. **Natural Light** Use natural light to your advantage by placing your dish near a window or outside. Soft, indirect light can enhance the colors and textures of your food.  ### 2. **Composition** Experiment with different compositions, such as: * **Overhead shot**: Shoot directly from above to showcase the dish's layout. * **45-degree angle**: Capture the dish from a 45-degree angle to add depth and visual interest. * **Close-up**: Zoom in on a specific ingredient or texture to create a mouth-watering effect.  ### 3. **Styling** Add props and garnishes to enhance the visual appeal of your dish. Consider using: * **Fresh herbs**: Add a sprig of fresh herbs to add color and fragrance. * **Edible flowers**: Use edible flowers to add a pop of color and whimsy. * **Textured backgrounds**: Use a textured background, such as a wooden board or a marble countertop, to add depth and interest.  ### 4. **Focus on Details** Highlight the textures, colors, and presentation of your dish. Use a macro lens or the camera's zoom feature to capture the intricate details.  ### 5. **Play with Angles and Perspectives** Don't be afraid to experiment with unusual angles and perspectives, such as: * **Low-angle shot**: Shoot from a low angle to create a dramatic effect. * **Bird's eye view**: Capture the dish from directly above to showcase the layout.  ### 6. **Use a Clean and Simple Background** A cluttered background can distract from the food. Use a clean and simple background, such as a white plate or a minimalist tablecloth, to let the dish be the focus.  ### 7. **Add a Storytelling Element** Share the story behind the dish, such as the recipe, cooking process, or cultural significance. This can help create a connection with your audience and make the image more engaging.  ### 8. **Experiment with Editing** Use Instagram's editing tools or third-party apps to enhance the colors, contrast, and overall look of your image. However, be mindful of over-editing, as it can make the image look unnatural.  By incorporating these creative techniques into your food photography, you can create visually appealing and engaging images that showcase your culinary creations and tell a story."

Use props: Adding props such as plates, utensils, napkins, or even flowers can help create a visually interesting and inviting scene.  4. Focus on details: Close-up shots of specific elements of your food, such as a juicy steak or a perfectly cooked egg, can draw the viewer's attention and create a sense of anticipation.  5. Use negative space: Leaving some empty space around your food can help make it the focal point of the image and create a clean, uncluttered look.  6. Add a human touch: Including a hand or a spoon in the frame can give a sense of scale and make the food look more inviting.  7. Experiment with composition: Try arranging your food in a visually pleasing way, such as using the rule of thirds or leading lines to guide the viewer's eye.  8. Edit your photos: Use photo editing apps to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation, and other settings to make your food look its best.  9. Tell a story: Consider the context of your food – where it was made, who made it, and why you chose it – and try to convey that story through your photo.  10. Be consistent: Develop a consistent aesthetic for your food photos, using similar colors, props, and editing styles to create a cohesive feed.  By applying these techniques, you can create visually appealing food photos that not only showcase your meals but also inspire others to try new dishes and learn about different cuisines."
19,gemini_rag,What are some creative ways to photograph food for an Instagram post?,"What we eat is one of the most frequent and important health decisions we make in daily life, yet it remains notoriously difficult to capture and understand. Effective food journaling is thus a grand challenge in personal health informatics. In this paper we describe a system for food journaling called I Ate This, which is inspired by the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM). I Ate This is simple: you use a smartphone app to take a photo and give a very basic description of any food or beverage you are about to consume. Later, a qualified dietitian will evaluate your photo, giving you feedback on how you did and where you can improve. The aim of I Ate This is to provide a convenient, visual and reliable way to help users learn from their eating habits and nudge them towards better choices each and every day. Ultimately, this incremental approach can lead to long-term behaviour change. Our goal is to bring RFPM to a wider audience, through APIs that can be incorporated into other apps.

The pervasiveness of mobile cameras has resulted in a dramatic increase in food photos, which are pictures reflecting what people eat. In this paper, we study how taking pictures of what we eat in restaurants can be used for the purpose of automating food journaling. We propose to leverage the context of where the picture was taken, with additional information about the restaurant, available online, coupled with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to recognize the food being consumed. To this end, we demonstrate image-based recognition of foods eaten in restaurants by training a classifier with images from restaurant's online menu databases. We evaluate the performance of our system in unconstrained, real-world settings with food images taken in 10 restaurants across 5 different types of food (American, Indian, Italian, Mexican and Thai).

People enjoy food photography because they appreciate food. Behind each meal there is a story described in a complex recipe and, unfortunately, by simply looking at a food image we do not have access to its preparation process. Therefore, in this paper we introduce an inverse cooking system that recreates cooking recipes given food images. Our system predicts ingredients as sets by means of a novel architecture, modeling their dependencies without imposing any order, and then generates cooking instructions by attending to both image and its inferred ingredients simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the whole system on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset and show that (1) we improve performance w.r.t. previous baselines for ingredient prediction; (2) we are able to obtain high quality recipes by leveraging both image and ingredients; (3) our system is able to produce more compelling recipes than retrieval-based approaches according to human judgment. We make code and models publicly available.",5.723104000091553,"Okay, based on the text and the general interest in food photography, here are some creative ideas for Instagram food photography, tailored to capture attention and align with the potential of the ""I Ate This"" system:  **Leveraging Storytelling & Context (Inspired by the Papers):**  *   **""Before & After"" Series:** Take a picture of the whole meal (the ""Before"") and then a picture of the plate after you've eaten it (""After""). This visually demonstrates consumption and encourages reflection on portion size and how much you actually ate, aligning with the core function of ""I Ate This."" Include a short caption about the taste, what you enjoyed, and whether you felt satisfied.  *   **Restaurant Exploration Series:** When eating out (like the second paper discussed), showcase the ambiance of the restaurant alongside the food. Take a photo of the restaurant exterior, the menu, the plating, and then a close-up of the dish. Tag the restaurant, and use hashtags like #restaurantreview, #foodadventure, and #whatieat. Consider adding a comment on the presentation and the overall experience.  *   **Ingredient Spotlight:** If you are taking a picture of food to journal, focus on the ingredients that are featured in the dish. Showcasing the freshness of these ingredients will draw attention to the user and their personal choices.   *   **""Recipe in a Photo"" Concept:** Although the third paper's methodology is a bit complicated, you can use the idea. Try to imply the recipe in your pictures. Take a picture of the ingredients laid out nicely before cooking, then show the dish once it's done. Caption: ""My version of [Dish Name], featuring [List some ingredients]. The full recipe will follow soon!"" Include a short description of the cooking process.  **Creative Composition & Techniques:**  *   **The ""Hands In Frame"" Shot:** Position your hands in the photo holding a piece of food, cutting a slice, or interacting with the meal. This adds a personal touch and gives a sense of scale.  *   **Action Shots:** Capture food in motion. Consider a drip of honey, a forkful of pasta being lifted, a sprinkle of toppings, or a pour of sauce. This creates dynamic and engaging content.  *   **Texture Focused:** Highlight the textures of the food. Get close-up shots to emphasize the crust of a bread, the crispness of a vegetable, or the creaminess of a sauce.  *   **Play with Color:** Use contrasting or complementary colors to make your food visually appealing. Consider using a clean, white background, using a patterned background that suits the context, or using ingredients like colorful vegetables in the dish.  *   **Overhead/Flat Lay:** A popular technique, but can be executed creatively. Arrange the food items beautifully and include some props (utensils, napkins, flowers, spices) to make it more visually interesting.  *   **Negative Space:** Use a simple background to create negative space around the food, allowing the food to be the focal point.  *   **Styling with Props:** Incorporate props that complement the food. This could include fresh herbs, flowers, kitchen utensils, cloth napkins, or even the ingredients themselves.  *   **Seasonal Themes:** Relate your photos to the season. Include food items with holiday themes, or seasonal fruits and vegetables that are commonly used during"

21,llama_rag,How do I explain a complex topic in a simple and engaging way?,"COMPLEX-IT is a case-based, mixed-methods platform for social inquiry into complex data/systems, designed to increase non-expert access to the tools of computational social science (i.e., cluster analysis, artificial intelligence, data visualization, data forecasting, and scenario simulation). In particular, COMPLEX-IT aids social inquiry though a heavy emphasis on learning about the complex data/system under study, which it does by (a) identifying and forecasting major and minor clusters/trends; (b) visualizing their complex causality; and (c) simulating scenarios for potential interventions. COMPLEX-IT is accessible through the web or can be run locally and is powered by R and the Shiny web framework.

Finally, the work will include an investigation of the contextual form of explanations. In this study, we will include a time-bounded scenario in which the different levels of understanding will be tested to enable us to evaluate suitable and comprehensible explanations. For this we have proposed different levels of understanding (LOU). A user study will be designed to compare different LOU for different contexts of interaction. A user study simultating a hospital environment will be investigated.

Explainability has become an important topic in computer science and artificial intelligence, leading to a subfield called Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The goal of providing or seeking explanations is to achieve (better) 'understanding' on the part of the explainee. However, what it means to 'understand' is still not clearly defined, and the concept itself is rarely the subject of scientific investigation. This conceptual article aims to present a model of forms of understanding in the context of XAI and beyond. From an interdisciplinary perspective bringing together computer science, linguistics, sociology, and psychology, a definition of understanding and its forms, assessment, and dynamics during the process of giving everyday explanations are explored.

That's where COMPLEX-IT comes in – a tool that helps you analyze complex data and understand what's going on. It uses techniques like cluster analysis and artificial intelligence to identify patterns and trends, visualize the relationships between different factors, and even simulate different scenarios to help you make decisions.  **But how do you know if you really understand what's going on?**  That's where the concept of ""understanding"" comes in. Researchers are trying to figure out what it means to ""understand"" something, especially when it comes to complex systems like artificial intelligence. They've identified two types of understanding: ""enabledness"" (knowing how to do something) and ""comprehension"" (knowing that something is true). Think of it like knowing how to ride a bike (enabledness) versus knowing that the sky is blue (comprehension).  **The goal is to provide explanations that help people gain a deeper understanding.**  In the context of XAI, explanations are crucial for building trust in AI systems. The researchers are working on a model that defines different levels of understanding and how to assess them. They're also testing different types of explanations to see what works best in different situations, like in a hospital setting.  **To simplify it further:**  1. COMPLEX-IT is a tool that helps analyze complex data and understand complex systems. 2. The goal of XAI is to provide explanations that help people understand AI systems. 3. Understanding comes in different forms, like ""enabledness"" and ""comprehension"". 4.

This is a complex task, but COMPLEX-IT makes it easier!  COMPLEX-IT is an online platform that helps you explore and understand complex data, like people in a community or trends in a market. It uses advanced tools like cluster analysis, artificial intelligence, data visualization, and scenario simulation to help you make sense of the data.  For example, if you're studying a community, COMPLEX-IT can help you identify different groups within the community (clusters), predict how these groups might change over time, show you how these groups are connected, and even simulate what might happen if you make certain changes.  But COMPLEX-IT doesn't just stop at showing you the data. It also helps you understand the reasons behind the trends and connections. This is like having a guide who can explain why certain things are happening in the data.  COMPLEX-IT is designed to be easy to use, whether you're accessing it online or running it on your own computer. It's powered by R and the Shiny web framework.  In addition, COMPLEX-IT is part of a larger research project that aims to understand how people understand complex information. This project includes a study that will test different ways of explaining complex data to see which ones are most effective. For this study, we'll be using a hospital environment as an example.  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a growing field that focuses on making sure that computers can explain their decisions in a way that people can understand. COMPLEX-IT is a great example of XAI in action, as it not only provides explanations, but also helps users understand the data and make decisions based on that understanding.  In summary, COMPLEX-IT is a powerful tool for understanding complex data, and it's part of a larger research project aimed at improving our understanding of how people understand complex information. By using COMPLEX-IT, you can gain a deeper understanding of the data and make more informed decisions."

This means rephrasing the criticism to show you understand and are open to considering it. The six strategies could be, for example:     *   **Paraphrasing:** Restate the criticism in your own words to ensure understanding.     *   **Finding Common Ground:** Identify areas where you agree with the critic.     *   **Acknowledging Strengths:** Even in disagreement, point out any valid points or strengths of the criticism.     *   **Exploring Alternatives:** Consider alternative solutions or perspectives and show willingness to explore them.     *   **Expressing Curiosity:** Use open questions.     *   **Expressing Gratitude:** Thanking the person for the time and effort  *   **Example (using reframing):** ""I appreciate you bringing up the potential impact of the model's behavior on users in edge cases. This is something we hadn't fully considered, and it's valuable to hear your perspective.""  **3. Respond Thoughtfully and Provide Context:**  *   **Provide Context, Not Justification:** Instead of just justifying your original work, offer more context that might have been missing. This is about informing the critic, not necessarily proving them wrong. *   **Explain your reasoning:** Clearly explain the rationale behind your decisions. Why did you take the approach you did? What were the trade-offs? *   **Be specific:** Avoid vague generalizations. Refer to specific points in the critique and the corresponding aspects of your work. *   **Acknowledge Limitations:** Be honest about the limitations of your work. No research is perfect. *   **Example:** ""Our decision to focus on X was based on Y, which we believed would be the most impactful for this initial study. We acknowledge that this approach may have limitations when applied to Z.""  **4. Suggest Future Steps (Focus on Improvement):**  *   **Show a willingness to learn:**  Demonstrate that you are open to improving your work based on the feedback. *   **Outline possible improvements:** Based on the criticism, describe the concrete changes you might make, or the areas you'll be exploring in future work. *   **If applicable, invite further discussion:** Encourage the critic to provide more input, or let them know how to continue the conversation. *   **Example:** ""This feedback gives us a great idea for our next step.

Paying close attention to something: Not that easy, is it? It's because our attention is pulled in so many different directions at a time, and it's in fact pretty impressive if you can stay focused.Many people think that attention is all about what we are focusing on, but it's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out.There are two ways you direct your attention. First, there's overt attention. In overt attention, you move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it. Then there's covert attention. In covert attention, you pay attention to something, but without moving your eyes. Think of driving for a second.

In this study, we have created a custom virtually relaxing environment including an archery game with multiple targets. In the experiment, the attention span of 12 adults are tested before and after the virtual reality session by a non-action video game ([19]) score and Muse headband EEG-signals. After the 10-minute virtual reality session participants' game scores increased (according to game experience): for the beginner by 275%, for intermediate by 107%, and for an expert by 17%.

The human brain and engineering systems, though different in many ways, share the common challenge of maintaining performance in the face of distractions or ""noise."" Here are some insights and methods that can help:  1. **Understanding Attention**: The first step is understanding how attention works. There are two types of attention: overt and covert. Overt attention involves directing your eyes towards something, while covert attention involves paying attention to something without looking directly at it. Recognizing how you use both can help you manage distractions.  2. **Attention Training**: Studies have shown that attention can be improved through training. Computer-based exercises and mindfulness meditation are effective methods. A novel approach mentioned involves using Virtual Reality (VR) for mindfulness meditation, which has been shown to improve sustained attention significantly.  3. **Using Technology**: Leveraging technology, such as VR or computer-based tasks, can help in training attention. The example given in the text involves a VR environment with an archery game that requires sustained attention. Participants showed significant improvement in their attention span after just a 10-minute session.  4. **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)**: For a more neuroscientific approach, BCIs can be used to understand brain patterns associated with attention. By analyzing these patterns, it's possible to develop models that can help in creating assistive devices or therapies for individuals with attention deficits.  5. **Minimizing Distractions**: While not directly mentioned, a practical step involves minimizing external distractions. This could mean creating a quiet workspace, using noise-cancelling headphones, or employing strategies to manage digital distractions (e.g., turning off notifications).  6. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: The VR study mentioned also highlights the importance of relaxation and mindfulness. Feeling ""recharged"" after the VR session indicates that reducing stress and promoting relaxation can also aid in improving focus.  7. **Adaptive Systems**: Engineering systems often use adaptive filters or algorithms to reduce noise. While the human brain doesn't work in exactly the same way, being aware of one's own ""noise"" (distractions, both internal and external) and adapting strategies to mitigate them can be seen as a form of cognitive adaptation.  In summary, staying focused in a distracting environment involves a combination of understanding how attention works, training one's attention, leveraging technology for support, and employing strategies to minimize distractions and enhance relaxation and mindfulness. While the human brain and engineering systems differ, insights from both fields can inform effective strategies for improving focus."

Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness meditation can help train your brain to focus and reduce distractions.  6. Use the Pomodoro Technique: This technique involves working for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes) followed by a short break (5 minutes).  7. Prioritize tasks: Focus on the most important tasks first and tackle them when you have the most energy and focus.  8. Eliminate distractions: Turn off notifications on your phone or computer, and remove any distractions from your workspace.  9. Use a timer: Setting a timer can help you stay focused and motivated to complete a task.  10. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can make it difficult to focus and increase distractions. Make sure to get enough rest each night.  Regarding the question about the similarities and differences between using the term ""noise"" in engineering and cognitive psychology, both fields use the term to refer to unwanted or random variations that interfere with performance. However, in engineering, noise is typically associated with physical measurements, while in cognitive psychology, it refers to cognitive distractions that interfere with attention and performance. The human brain and engineering control systems use different approaches to attenuate noise, but both aim to achieve optimal performance.  In terms of brain patterns, computational neuroscientists study brain activity to build models for computers that can recognize and mimic brain functions. Choosing the right brain patterns is crucial for building accurate models and developing effective therapies. Attention is one of the brain functions that is particularly important for many everyday tasks, and attention training can lead to improved focus and performance.

The key is recognizing that attention is not just about what you focus on, but also about what your brain chooses to ignore. *   **Overt vs. Covert Attention:**     *   **Overt Attention:** Directly looking at what you're focusing on.     *   **Covert Attention:** Focusing on something without moving your eyes (e.g., driving and scanning surroundings). *   **Attention Training:** Studies suggest that training attention using computer-based exercises, including virtual reality (VR), can improve focus and attention span. *   **VR Meditation for Sustained Attention:** Research shows short VR mindfulness meditation sessions (e.g., archery game) can significantly improve sustained attention, as measured by game scores and EEG data (calm points). Participants reported feeling recharged.  **How to Stay Focused in a Noisy/Distracting Environment (Based on the Above):**  1.  **Active Filtering:** Recognize that your brain naturally filters. Actively try to direct your brain to prioritize the relevant information and consciously ignore distractions. This takes practice. 2.  **Use Covert Attention:** Instead of constantly looking at the source of distraction (overt attention), try to maintain your focus on the task at hand (overt) and use your peripheral vision (covert attention) to briefly scan the environment for potential threats or relevant information. 3.  **Attention Training:** Consider exercises designed to improve your attention. This could include:     *   **Mindfulness Meditation:** This, particularly with VR, has shown positive results.     *   **Computer-Based Exercises:** Explore options like games that challenge your attention and focus (e.g., those that train executive functions). 4.  **Create a Relaxing Environment (Where Possible):** VR sessions are designed to produce a relaxing environment. While you can't always control the environment, you can introduce relaxation techniques. 5.  **Take Breaks:** Prolonged focus is difficult. The text highlights that short training can be effective, meaning that breaks during focus sessions can be useful. 6. **Manage Your Brain Patterns:** Based on the article, attention issues may be caused by the wrong patterns. Explore therapies in order to fix your attention problems.  **Additional General Strategies (Based on Common Knowledge, Combining with Text):**  *   **Minimize Distractions:**     *   **Physical Environment:** If possible, create a workspace that is as quiet and free of visual distractions as possible. (Noise-canceling headphones, a clean desk, etc.)     *   **Digital Environment:** Close unnecessary browser tabs, turn off notifications, and put your phone away. *   **Develop Routines:** Consistency and routine can help the brain anticipate tasks and reduce the cognitive load of ""getting started."" *   **Break Down Tasks:** Large tasks can feel overwhelming. Break them into smaller, more manageable steps. *   **Practice Mindfulness:** Meditation and mindfulness practices can train your brain to better regulate attention and reduce mind-wandering. *   **Get Enough Sleep:** Lack of sleep significantly impairs focus and cognitive function. *   **Prioritize Physical and Mental Health:** Regular exercise"

Here’s a structured breakdown of strategies and insights from these fields:  ---  ### **1. Cognitive Strategies for Humans** #### **A. Attention Control Mechanisms** - **Overt vs. Covert Attention**:     - *Overt*: Directing sensory organs (e.g., eyes) toward a task (e.g., reading).     - *Covert*: Mentally focusing without physical movement (e.g., monitoring surroundings while driving).     - *Application*: Train covert attention to filter distractions while maintaining task focus.  - **Selective Attention**:     - The brain uses ""top-down"" (goal-directed) and ""bottom-up"" (stimulus-driven) processes to prioritize information.     - *Example*: Ignoring background chatter by concentrating on a book (top-down) vs. being startled by a loud noise (bottom-up).  #### **B. Behavioral Techniques** - **Environmental Modifications**:     - Use noise-canceling headphones or white noise to mask disruptive sounds.     - Designate a clutter-free workspace to reduce visual distractions.   - **Pomodoro Technique**: Work in short bursts (e.g., 25 minutes) with breaks to combat attentional fatigue.   - **Mindfulness Meditation**: Practices like VR-based meditation (as in your study) can enhance sustained attention by training the brain to return focus to a target (e.g., breath or archery targets).    #### **C.

Engineering Parallels: Noise Attenuation** #### **A. Measurement Noise vs. Cognitive Noise**   - **Engineering**: Noise refers to random signal interference (e.g., sensor errors). Solutions include:     - *Filtering* (e.g., Kalman filters) to separate signal from noise.     - *Redundancy* (e.g., multiple sensors) to average out errors.   - **Cognitive Psychology**: ""Noise"" is irrelevant sensory or internal (e.g., intrusive thoughts) input. The brain uses:     - *Adaptive filtering*: Prioritizing task-relevant inputs (similar to a bandpass filter).     - *Predictive coding*: Anticipating expected signals (e.g., ignoring predictable office sounds).    #### **B. Shared Principles**   - **Feedback Loops**:     - *Engineering*: Systems adjust based on output error (e.g., thermostat).     - *Brain*: Dopaminergic signals reinforce focus when goals are met.   - **Redundancy**:     - *Engineering*: Backup systems.     - *Brain*: Parallel neural pathways (e.g., visual and auditory attention networks).    ---  ### **3.

25,llama_rag,What are the key elements of a successful blog?,"This paper examines the emerging phenomenon of blogging, using three different Polish blogging services as the base of the research. Authors show that blog networks are sharing their characteristics with complex networks gamma coefficients, small worlds, cliques, etc.). Elements of sociometric analysis were used to prove existence of some social structures in the blog networks.

Blogs have recently become one of the most favored services on the Web. Many users maintain a blog and write posts to express their opinion, experience and knowledge about a product, an event and every subject of general or specific interest. More users visit blogs to read these posts and comment them. This ""participatory journalism"" of blogs has such an impact upon the masses that Keller and Berry argued that through blogging ""one American in tens tells the other nine how to vote, where to eat and what to buy"" \cite{keller1}. Therefore, a significant issue is how to identify such influential bloggers. This problem is very new and the relevant literature lacks sophisticated solutions, but most importantly these solutions have not taken into account temporal aspects for identifying influential bloggers, even though the time is the most critical aspect of the Blogosphere. This article investigates the issue of identifying influential bloggers by proposing two easily computed blogger ranking methods, which incorporate temporal aspects of the blogging activity. Each method is based on a specific metric to score the blogger's posts. The first metric, termed MEIBI, takes into consideration the number of the blog post's inlinks and its comments, along with the publication date of the post. The second metric, MEIBIX, is used to score a blog post according to the number and age of the blog post's inlinks and its comments. These methods are evaluated against the state-of-the-art influential blogger identification method utilizing data collected from a real-world community blog site. The obtained results attest that the new methods are able to better identify significant temporal patterns in the blogging behaviour.

Blogs have become one of the most successful tools of the Web 2.0 because of their ease of use and the availability of open platforms. They have quickly spread in the education field thanks to the many attractive qualities that have been attributed to them, such as collaboration, communication, enhancing of professional writing, and the improvement of information-gathering skills. However, many of the studies that have addressed this issue were not based on an empirical research, and therefore they are unreliable.

To identify the key elements of a successful blog, we can analyze the common themes and findings across these papers.  While the papers focus on different aspects of blogging, such as the structure of blog networks, identifying influential bloggers, and the use of blogs in education, we can extract some insights related to the key elements of a successful blog.  1. **Influence and impact**: The papers suggest that influential bloggers are those who can shape opinions, experiences, and knowledge on various subjects. A successful blog is likely one that has a significant impact on its readers. 2. **Content and engagement**: The number of inlinks, comments, and the age of these interactions are used as metrics to score a blog post's influence. This implies that a successful blog is one that generates engaging content, encourages discussion, and is linked to by other reputable sources. 3. **Temporal aspects**: The papers highlight the importance of considering the temporal aspects of blogging, such as the publication date of posts and the age of inlinks and comments. A successful blog is likely one that is regularly updated and maintains a consistent level of engagement over time. 4. **Network and community**: The analysis of blog networks reveals the existence of social structures, such as cliques and small worlds. A successful blog is likely one that is part of a larger network or community, with connections to other influential bloggers and readers.  Based on these insights, the key elements of a successful blog can be summarized as:  1. **High-quality, engaging content**: A successful blog is one that generates interesting, informative, and relevant content that resonates with its target audience. 2. **Strong engagement and interaction**: A successful blog encourages discussion, responds to comments, and fosters a sense of community among its readers. 3. **Regular updates and consistency**: A successful blog is regularly updated with fresh content, maintaining a consistent level of quality and engagement over time. 4. **Integration with a larger network or community**: A successful blog is connected to other influential bloggers, readers, and online communities, amplifying its reach and impact.  These elements are not exhaustive, but they provide a starting point for understanding the characteristics of a successful blog."

Elements of sociometric analysis were used to prove existence of some social structures in the blog networks.

Blogs have recently become one of the most favored services on the Web. Many users maintain a blog and write posts to express their opinion, experience and knowledge about a product, an event and every subject of general or specific interest. More users visit blogs to read these posts and comment them. This ""participatory journalism"" of blogs has such an impact upon the masses that Keller and Berry argued that through blogging ""one American in tens tells the other nine how to vote, where to eat and what to buy"" \cite{keller1}. Therefore, a significant issue is how to identify such influential bloggers. This problem is very new and the relevant literature lacks sophisticated solutions, but most importantly these solutions have not taken into account temporal aspects for identifying influential bloggers, even though the time is the most critical aspect of the Blogosphere. This article investigates the issue of identifying influential bloggers by proposing two easily computed blogger ranking methods, which incorporate temporal aspects of the blogging activity. Each method is based on a specific metric to score the blogger's posts. The first metric, termed MEIBI, takes into consideration the number of the blog post's inlinks and its comments, along with the publication date of the post. The second metric, MEIBIX, is used to score a blog post according to the number and age of the blog post's inlinks and its comments. These methods are evaluated against the state-of-the-art influential blogger identification method utilizing data collected from a real-world community blog site. The obtained results attest that the new methods are able to better identify significant temporal patterns in the blogging behaviour.

Blogs have become one of the most successful tools of the Web 2.0 because of their ease of use and the availability of open platforms. They have quickly spread in the education field thanks to the many attractive qualities that have been attributed to them, such as collaboration, communication, enhancing of professional writing, and the improvement of information-gathering skills.

This includes the accuracy, relevance, and originality of the information provided. Blogs that offer unique insights, expert advice, or engaging stories tend to attract more readers.  2. **Engagement**: A successful blog encourages engagement from its readers. This can be achieved through interactive elements such as comments, polls, or forums. Engagement not only helps to build a community around the blog but also provides valuable feedback for the blogger.  3. **SEO Optimization**: To increase visibility and reach a wider audience, blogs should be optimized for search engines. This includes using relevant keywords, optimizing images, and ensuring the blog is mobile-friendly.  4. **Regular Updates**: Consistency is key in blogging. Regularly updating the blog with fresh content helps to maintain reader interest and improves search engine rankings.  5. **Social Sharing**: Making it easy for readers to share blog posts on social media platforms can help to increase the blog's reach. This can be achieved by including social sharing buttons on the blog.  6. **Design and Usability**: A well-designed, easy-to-navigate blog can enhance the user experience and encourage readers to stay longer and explore more content.  7. **Influencer Identification**: Identifying and engaging with influential bloggers in the same niche can help to increase the blog's visibility and credibility.  8. **Empirical Research**: In the case of educational blogs, empirical research is crucial to validate the effectiveness of the blog in achieving its intended goals. This includes using control groups, conducting surveys, and analyzing self-reported data.  9. **Temporal Aspects**: As the research suggests, the time factor plays a significant role in the Blogosphere. Therefore, it's important to consider the temporal aspects of blogging activity when identifying influential bloggers.  10. **Network Analysis**: Blog networks share characteristics with complex networks, and sociometric analysis can help to identify social structures within these networks. Understanding these structures can provide insights into the dynamics of the Blogosphere."

Designing waterfront redevelopment generally focuses on attractiveness, leisure, and beauty, resulting in various types of building and block shapes with limited considerations on environmental aspects. However, increasing climate change impacts necessitate these buildings to be sustainable, resilient, and zero CO2 emissions. By producing five scenarios (plus existing buildings) with constant floor areas, we investigated how building and district form with building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) affect energy consumption and production, self-sufficiency, CO2 emission, and energy costs in the context of waterfront redevelopment in Tokyo. From estimated hourly electricity demands of the buildings, techno-economic analyses are conducted for rooftop PV systems for 2018 and 2030 with declining costs of rooftop PV systems. We found that environmental building designs with rooftop PV system are increasingly economical in Tokyo with CO2 emission reduction of 2-9% that depends on rooftop sizes. Payback periods drop from 14 years in 2018 to 6 years in 2030. Toward net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, immediate actions are necessary to install rooftop PVs on existing and new buildings with energy efficiency improvements by construction industry and building owners.

27,llama_rag,Share your skincare routine that works for sensitive skin.,"Skin conditions affect an estimated 1.9 billion people worldwide. A shortage of dermatologists causes long wait times and leads patients to seek dermatologic care from general practitioners. However, the diagnostic accuracy of general practitioners has been reported to be only 0.24-0.70 (compared to 0.77-0.96 for dermatologists), resulting in referral errors, delays in care, and errors in diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we developed a deep learning system (DLS) to provide a differential diagnosis of skin conditions for clinical cases (skin photographs and associated medical histories). The DLS distinguishes between 26 skin conditions that represent roughly 80% of the volume of skin conditions seen in primary care. The DLS was developed and validated using de-identified cases from a teledermatology practice serving 17 clinical sites via a temporal split: the first 14,021 cases for development and the last 3,756 cases for validation. On the validation set, where a panel of three board-certified dermatologists defined the reference standard for every case, the DLS achieved 0.71 and 0.93 top-1 and top-3 accuracies respectively. For a random subset of the validation set (n=963 cases), 18 clinicians reviewed the cases for comparison. On this subset, the DLS achieved a 0.67 top-1 accuracy, non-inferior to board-certified dermatologists (0.63, p<0.001), and higher than primary care physicians (PCPs, 0.45) and nurse practitioners (NPs, 0.41). The top-3 accuracy showed a similar trend: 0.90 DLS, 0.75 dermatologists, 0.60 PCPs, and 0.55 NPs. These results highlight the potential of the DLS to augment general practitioners to accurately diagnose skin conditions by suggesting differential diagnoses that may not have been considered. Future work will be needed to prospectively assess the clinical impact of using this tool in actual clinical workflows.

The original method of treatment of various pathological processes in human skin covers is described. The method has a brightly expressed differential action: destroying pathologic cells it does not render any influence on healthy cells.

Direct and alternating current iontophoresis and electro-osmosis methodologies have provided new methods of transcutaneous drug delivery. A byproduct of such methods is lowering the electrical impedance of the electrode to skin contact, as conductive ions permeate the stratum corneum, the primary resistive layer of the skin. We developed a method for adapting iontophoresis to condition the electrode to skin contact, both for electrophysiological recording and electrical stimulation of body tissues. By utilizing direct current to treat electrodes with high impedance we show the effectiveness of iontopheresis as a driving force for permeation of ionic electrolyte into the skin barrier. We applied direct current (DC) levels of 50 {\mu}A to electrodes on the human head for 30 seconds with paste (Nihon Kohden Elefix) electrolyte. Typically immediately after DC treatment conditioning there was an impedance drop of 10-30%. The effect was lasting over several hours, with the paste electrolyte. These results demonstrate the feasibility of DC conditioning to reduce the set time of electrolytic solutions and to maintain good skin contact during extended recording or stimulation sessions.",5.295673847198486,"As a computer program, I don't have personal experiences or a physical body, so I don't have a skincare routine. However, I can provide general information on skincare routines that may be suitable for sensitive skin.  For sensitive skin, it's often recommended to follow a simple, gentle skincare routine that minimizes irritation and avoids harsh products. Here are some general tips:  1. **Cleanse gently**: Use a mild, fragrance-free cleanser that is formulated for sensitive skin. Avoid using hot water, which can strip the skin of its natural oils. Instead, use lukewarm water and pat dry with a towel. 2. **Moisturize**: Apply a gentle, non-comedogenic moisturizer that is fragrance-free and hypoallergenic. This can help to soothe and protect the skin. 3. **Protect from the sun**: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of at least 30, and apply it daily, even on cloudy days. 4. **Avoid irritants**: Steer clear of products that contain harsh ingredients, such as alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), or artificial fragrances, which can irritate sensitive skin. 5. **Be gentle when exfoliating**: If you need to exfoliate, use a gentle exfoliant, such as a chemical exfoliant containing polyhydroxy acids (PHAs) or a physical exfoliant with gentle, round particles.  Some common skincare products that are often recommended for sensitive skin include:  * Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser * Neutrogena Hydrating Facial Moisturizer * La Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra Fluid * EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46  It's always a good idea to consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional to determine the best skincare routine for your individual skin type and concerns.  The text you provided appears to be a collection of abstracts or summaries of research papers related to skin conditions and dermatology. The papers discuss various topics, including the development of a deep learning system for diagnosing skin conditions, a method for treating skin pathologies, and the use of iontophoresis to improve electrode-skin contact. While these papers may be of interest to dermatology professionals or researchers, they don't provide specific information on skincare routines for sensitive skin."

A cream or gel cleanser is often better tolerated than foaming cleansers. I recommend Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser or CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser.  2. **Tone**: Opt for an alcohol-free toner to balance your skin's pH and remove any remaining impurities. Look for toners that contain soothing ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile, or green tea. La Roche-Posay Thermal Water or CeraVe Hydrating Facial Toner are good options.  3. **Exfoliate**: Exfoliate once or twice a week with a gentle exfoliator or a chemical exfoliant containing ingredients like glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. Be careful not to over-exfoliate, as it can irritate sensitive skin.  4. **Treat**: Apply a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or niacinamide to help soothe, hydrate, and protect your skin. If you have specific concerns like redness, dark spots, or acne, consider using a targeted treatment product.  5. **Sunscreen**: Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day, even on cloudy days. Look for a sunscreen that is lightweight, non-comedogenic, and suitable for sensitive skin.  6. **Nighttime Routine**: At night, you can use a heavier moisturizer or an overnight mask to provide extra hydration while you sleep. If you have dry skin, you might also consider using an oil or a cream with ingredients like jojoba oil, shea butter, or squalane.  7. **Avoid**: Try to avoid products with harsh ingredients like alcohol, fragrances, dyes, and exfoliating beads, as they can irritate sensitive skin. Also, be cautious when trying new products, as it's essential to patch test them first to ensure they don't cause any adverse reactions.  8. **Consult a Dermatologist**: If you have persistent skin concerns or if your skin becomes irritated or sensitive, it's always a good idea to consult a dermatologist for personalized advice and treatment recommendations."

28,llama_rag,Share some advice you’d give to your younger self just starting college.,"Getting a college education is a 20-year investment. When you're growing up poor, you're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead. Instead, you're thinking about where you're going to get your next meal and how your family is going to pay rent that month. Besides, my parents and my friends' parents seemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors. It wasn't until I was a teenager when I realized I didn't want to do those things. By then, I was two-thirds of the way through my education, and it was almost too late to turn things around.When you grow up poor, you want to be rich. I was no different. I'm the second-oldest of seven, and was raised by a single mother on government aid in Queens, New York. By virtue of growing up low-income, my siblings and I went to some of New York City's most struggling public schools. I had over 60 absences when I was in seventh grade, because I didn't feel like going to class. My high school had a 55 percent graduation rate, and even worse, only 20 percent of the kids graduating were college-ready.When I actually did make it to college, I told my friend Brennan how our teachers would always ask us to raise our hands if we were going to college. I was taken aback when Brennan said, ""Karim, I've never been asked that question before."" It was always, ""What college are you going to?"" Just the way that question is phrased made it unacceptable for him not to have gone to college.Nowadays I get asked a different question. ""How were

I would like to share with you a new model of higher education, a model that, once expanded, can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind. Look at the world. Pick a place and focus on it. You will find humans chasing higher education. Let's meet some of them.Patrick. Patrick was born in Liberia to a family of 20 children. During the civil war, he and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria. There, in spite of his situation, he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades. He wanted to continue to higher education, but due to his family living on the poverty line, he was soon sent to South Africa to work and send back money to feed his family. Patrick never gave up his dream of higher education. Late at night, after work, he surfed the net, looking for ways to study.Meet Debbie. Debbie is from Florida. Her parents didn't go to college, and neither did any of her siblings. Debbie has worked all her life, pays taxes, supports herself month to month, proud of the American dream, a dream that just won't be complete without higher education. But Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education. She can't pay the tuition. Neither could she leave work.Meet Wael. Wael is from Syria. He's experiencing firsthand the misery, fear and failure imposed on his country. He's a big believer in education. He knew that if he could find an opportunity for higher education, an opportunity to get ahead of the

So I'll be talking about the success of my campus, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC, in educating students of all types, across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas. What makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder — students of color, students underrepresented in selected areas. And what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students, students from low-income backgrounds, to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering.And so I begin with a story about my childhood. We all are products of our childhood experiences. It's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama, a kid who loved getting A's, a kid who loved math, who loved to read, a kid who would say to the teacher — when the teacher said, ""Here are 10 problems,"" to the class, this little fat kid would say, ""Give us 10 more."" And the whole class would say, ""Shut up, Freeman."" And there was a designated kicker every day. And so I was always asking this question: ""Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?""And amazingly, one week in church, when I really didn't want to be there and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems, I heard this man say this: ""If we can get the children",4.807116985321045,"Based on the text, here is some advice that the author, Karim, might give to his younger self just starting college:  1. **Think long-term**: Growing up poor, it's natural to focus on short-term needs like paying rent and getting the next meal. However, Karim learned that a college education is a 20-year investment. He would advise his younger self to think more about the long-term benefits of education and plan accordingly. 2. **Take education seriously**: Karim had a rough start in school, with over 60 absences in seventh grade and attending a high school with a low graduation rate. He would advise his younger self to take education more seriously and make the most of the opportunities available. 3. **Be proactive**: Patrick, Debbie, and Wael's stories highlight the challenges faced by individuals from low-income backgrounds or those affected by conflict. Karim would likely advise his younger self to be more proactive in seeking out resources and opportunities to support his education. 4. **Don't be limited by your environment**: Karim's friend Brennan was always asked, ""What college are you going to?"" rather than ""Are you going to college?"" This subtle difference in expectation made a significant impact. Karim would advise his younger self to surround himself with people who believe in his potential and to not be limited by the expectations of those around him. 5. **Pursue opportunities**: The stories of Patrick, Debbie, and Wael demonstrate the determination and resilience required to pursue higher education despite adversity. Karim would likely advise his younger self to be more determined and to seek out opportunities, like those available at UMBC, that can support his academic success.  Some specific advice Karim might give to his younger self is:  * ""Take your education seriously, and don't be afraid to ask for help."" * ""Surround yourself with people who believe in your potential."" * ""Think about the long-term benefits of your education, and plan accordingly."" * ""Be proactive in seeking out resources and opportunities to support your education."" * ""Don't be limited by your environment or the expectations of those around you."""

I would like to share with you a new model of higher education, a model that, once expanded, can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind. Look at the world. Pick a place and focus on it. You will find humans chasing higher education. Let's meet some of them.Patrick. Patrick was born in Liberia to a family of 20 children. During the civil war, he and his family were forced to flee to Nigeria. There, in spite of his situation, he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades. He wanted to continue to higher education, but due to his family living on the poverty line, he was soon sent to South Africa to work and send back money to feed his family. Patrick never gave up his dream of higher education. Late at night, after work, he surfed the net, looking for ways to study.Meet Debbie. Debbie is from Florida. Her parents didn't go to college, and neither did any of her siblings. Debbie has worked all her life, pays taxes, supports herself month to month, proud of the American dream, a dream that just won't be complete without higher education. But Debbie doesn't have the savings for higher education. She can't pay the tuition. Neither could she leave work.Meet Wael. Wael is from Syria.

So I'll be talking about the success of my campus, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC, in educating students of all types, across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas. What makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder — students of color, students underrepresented in selected areas. And what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students, students from low-income backgrounds, to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering.And so I begin with a story about my childhood. We all are products of our childhood experiences. It's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama, a kid who loved getting A's, a kid who loved math, who loved to read, a kid who would say to the teacher — when the teacher said, ""Here are 10 problems,"" to the class, this little fat kid would say, ""Give us 10 more."" And the whole class would say, ""Shut up, Freeman."" And there was a designated kicker every day. And so I was always asking this question: ""Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?""And amazingly, one week in church, when I really didn't want to be there and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems, I heard this man say this: ""If we can get the children",3.7753798961639404," Here are some pieces of advice I would give to my younger self just starting college:  1. Embrace the long-term view: College is an investment in your future, and it's important to think about the long-term benefits it can bring. Don't be discouraged by the immediate challenges or the financial burden; focus on the potential for personal and professional growth.  2. Take advantage of resources: Seek out academic support, mentorship, and opportunities to get involved in extracurricular activities. Don't be afraid to ask for help or guidance when you need it.  3. Be open-minded: College is a time to explore new ideas, meet people from different backgrounds, and challenge your own beliefs. Be open to new experiences and perspectives, and don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone.  4. Prioritize self-care: College can be stressful, and it's important to take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Make time for exercise, sleep, and relaxation, and don't neglect your mental health.  5. Stay focused: It's easy to get distracted by social activities and other distractions, but it's important to stay focused on your academic goals. Set clear priorities and stick to them, and don't let yourself get derailed by distractions.  6. Build a network: College is a great opportunity to build a network of friends, mentors, and professional contacts. Take advantage of this by getting involved in clubs, organizations, and internships, and don't be afraid to reach out to people who can help you achieve your goals.  7. Be persistent: College is a marathon, not a sprint, and it's important to be persistent in the face of challenges. Don't give up on your dreams, and don't be discouraged by setbacks. Keep pushing forward and stay focused on your goals.  8. Embrace failure: Failure is a natural part of the learning process, and it's important to embrace it as an opportunity to grow and learn. Don't be afraid to take risks and try new things, even if you're not sure you'll succeed.  9. Stay curious: College is a time to ask questions, explore new ideas, and challenge your own assumptions. Don't be afraid to ask questions, even if you think they might be stupid or obvious. Curiosity is a powerful tool for learning and growth.  10. Enjoy the journey: College is a unique and special time in your life, and it's important to enjoy the journey. Don't get too caught up in the stress and pressure of academics; take time to appreciate the people, experiences, and opportunities that come your way."

It's tempting to look around at your classmates and feel like you're behind, like you're not ""supposed"" to be here. Ignore that feeling. You *belong*. You earned this.  Here's what you need to know:  *   **This is a long game, but it's worth it.** Remember what it felt like to grow up? The constant worry about where your next meal would come from? College *is* a long-term investment, but it's an investment in yourself and your future. This is your chance to change the trajectory of your life, to build a better future for yourself and, potentially, for your family. Keep that in mind when it gets tough. *   **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** You're not the only one who feels overwhelmed, confused, or like you don't know the ""rules."" Go to your professors during office hours, talk to the advisors, and seek out tutoring if you're struggling. College has resources, but you have to use them. Lean on your peers, create a support system, and navigate together. *   **Embrace the discomfort.** You're going to feel out of your depth sometimes. You're going to encounter new ideas, challenge your own beliefs, and maybe even fail. That's okay! It's part of the process. The most important thing is to keep learning and growing. Don't be afraid to step outside your comfort zone and try new things. *   **Make connections.** Build relationships with your professors, classmates, and anyone else you meet. These are the people who can support you, challenge you, and open doors for you. Find mentors who can guide you on your journey. *   **Take advantage of opportunities.** College offers so many opportunities: internships, research projects, study abroad programs, clubs, and organizations. Get involved! These experiences will not only enhance your education but also help you discover your passions and build skills that will serve you well in the future. *   **Don't let your background define you.** You come from a place where success wasn't always a given. Use that as fuel. It's a source of strength. Don't let your past, or the expectations others may have, limit your dreams. It's okay to want more. It's okay to strive for things that feel out of reach. *   **Prioritize your well-being.** College can be stressful. Make sure you're taking care of yourself: eat well, exercise, get enough sleep, and find healthy ways to manage stress. Don't forget to take time for fun and enjoyment. You deserve it. You can not pour from an empty cup. *   **Think beyond the next paycheck.** Education is about so much more than money. It's about expanding your horizons, developing critical thinking skills, and becoming a well-rounded individual. Keep your eyes on the bigger picture. *   **Be curious"

Your Background Is a Strength, Not a Limitation**   You’ve already beaten odds many couldn’t imagine. The resilience you’ve built from scarcity, instability, or systemic barriers? That’s your superpower. Don’t downplay it—use it. Many of your peers have never faced the challenges you’ve navigated. Your perspective is valuable.    ### **2. College Isn’t Just About Grades—It’s About Networks**   No one cares about your GPA after your first job. What matters:   - **Relationships**: Befriend professors, join clubs, attend office hours. The person sitting next to you might be your future business partner or referral.   - **Skills**: Learn to write, speak, and think critically. Take a public speaking class if nothing else.   - **Experiences**: Internships, research, or part-time jobs in your field > straight A’s with no real-world application.    ### **3. Ask for Help Early and Often**   Struggling in a class? Visit the tutoring center *now*, not after you fail the midterm. Need money for textbooks? Ask the financial aid office about emergency grants. Pride won’t pay your bills or pass your courses. Resources exist—use them.    ### **4. Debt Is a Tool, Not a Trap**   If you’re taking loans:   - **Major matters**: A $50k loan for engineering? Probably fine. The same for a degree with no clear ROI? Be cautious.   - **Work part-time**: Even 10 hours/week in a lab, library, or campus job builds résumé lines and cuts debt.   - **Apply for every scholarship**: $500 here and there adds up.    ### **5. “Rich” Isn’t Just Money—It’s Options**   You’re in college to buy yourself *choices*. A degree won’t magically make you wealthy, but it’ll open doors your parents never had. Want to be a janitor? Fine. Want to be a CEO? Now you *can*. The goal is agency.    ### **6. You’ll Feel Like an Imposter. Everyone Does.**   That kid who sounds smarter? They’re faking it too. The professor who seems intimidating? They once failed a class. College is full of people pretending they belong—until they realize they *do*.    ### **7. Time Is Your Most Valuable Asset**   - **Skip the ""grind"" mentality**: 4 hours of focused work > 8 hours of distracted cramming.   - **Schedule rest**: Burnout isn’t a badge of honor. Sleep. Eat. Call your mom.   - **Drop the guilt**: Taking a break isn’t laziness; it’s sustainability.    ### **8. Failure Isn’t the End—It’s Data**   Failed a test? Changed majors three times? Good. Now you know what *doesn’t* work. The only real failure is not trying because you’re afraid to mess up.    ### **9. Don’t Wait for Permission**   No one will tap you on the shoulder and"

Based on your hints, I'm going to take a educated guess that the book you're thinking of is ""The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence"" by Avron Barr and Edward A. Feigenbaum, but more likely you're referring to a different book.  However, one book that fits your description of being from 1988 and having a significant impact is ""The Society of Mind"" by Marvin Minsky. It was published in 1988 and is available for free in PDF format from the author's MIT page, with various bookmarks and annotations possible.  That being said, another strong candidate is ""The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence, Volume 3"" not being the likely candidate, but a more probable one is a different influential book.  A very influential book that fits some of your hints is ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman, although it was published much later, in 2011. However, a classic that changed many minds is ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"" by Douglas Hofstadter, published in 1979.  Yet, a more likely candidate is a seminal work like ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" by Thomas Kuhn, published in 1962.   One more possibility is that the book is indeed related to cognitive science or artificial intelligence, given the mention of ""seemingly distinct yet deeply connected subjects.""   To directly answer your query without more specific details, here are a few influential books across various categories that have changed the way people think:  1. **""Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"" by Yuval Noah Harari** - Offers a sweeping narrative that covers the entire history of humankind. 2. **""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman** - A foundational text in behavioral economics that explores how our brains make decisions. 3. **""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle** - A spiritual guide to living in the present. 4. **""Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid"" by Douglas Hofstadter** - Explores the connections between logic, art, and the human mind. 5. **""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" by Thomas Kuhn** - Challenges traditional views of the history and philosophy of science.  If you could provide more details or clarify the book you're thinking of, I'd be happy to give a more precise recommendation or discussion starter for your mini book club!"

In the first edition of this Handbook, two remarkable chapters consider seemingly distinct yet deeply connected subjects ...",4.149511098861694," I'm delighted to share some books that have significantly influenced my perspective on various topics. Here are my recommendations, along with a brief description of each:  1. ""Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"" by Yuval Noah Harari    - This book provides a sweeping narrative of the history of Homo sapiens, from the emergence of our species to the modern world. It challenges conventional wisdom and encourages readers to rethink their understanding of human history, culture, and identity.  2. ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman    - Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in Economics, explores the two systems that drive the way we think: System 1, fast, intuitive thinking, and System 2, slow, deliberate thinking. This book offers insights into how our biases and heuristics shape our decisions and perceptions.  3. ""Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies"" by Jared Diamond    - Diamond examines the factors that have shaped the course of human history, focusing on geography, technology, and culture. This book challenges the notion of racial superiority and encourages readers to consider the complex interplay of factors that have led to the development of different societies.  4. ""The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment"" by Eckhart Tolle    - Tolle invites readers to live in the present moment, arguing that our suffering stems from our attachment to the past and fear of the future. This book offers practical advice for cultivating mindfulness and living a more fulfilling life.  5. ""The Man Who Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan"" by Robert Kanigel    - This biography of the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan offers a fascinating exploration of the power of mathematical intuition and the interplay between Eastern and Western mathematics.  6. ""The Gene: An Intimate History"" by Siddhartha Mukherjee    - Mukherjee traces the history of genetics, from its origins to the latest breakthroughs in gene editing. This book offers a thought-provoking exploration of the ethical, social, and scientific implications of our growing understanding of the genetic basis of life.  7. ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu    - This ancient Chinese military treatise offers timeless wisdom on strategy, leadership, and decision-making. It encourages readers to think deeply about the nature of conflict and the art of winning without fighting.  8. ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" by Thomas S. Kuhn    - Kuhn challenges the traditional view of science as a steady, linear progression of knowledge. Instead, he argues that scientific progress is characterized by periods of normal science, followed by revolutionary shifts in paradigms. This book offers a new way of understanding the nature of scientific discovery and the role of human judgment in the scientific process.  9. ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" by Steven Pinker    - Pinker challenges the common perception that violence is an inherent part"

In the first edition of this Handbook, two remarkable chapters consider seemingly distinct yet deeply connected subjects ...",5.253494024276733,"Okay, based on your prompt, here are a few recommendations of books that have significantly altered my perspective, geared toward a mini book club, and with considerations for availability and accessibility (especially the ""now free, with corrections and bookmarks"" aspect):  **My Recommendations:**  1.  **""Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"" by Yuval Noah Harari:**      *   **Why it changed my thinking:** This book provides a breathtakingly broad overview of human history, challenging common assumptions about our species. It fundamentally reshaped my understanding of topics like the agricultural revolution, the development of money, the rise of empires, and the very nature of happiness. It encourages a critical look at the narratives we tell ourselves about who we are and how we got here.     *   **Considerations for a book club:** It's a long read, but highly engaging. It sparks fantastic discussions about societal structures, the impact of technology, and the future of humanity.     *   **Accessibility:**  *Sapiens* is widely available in various formats: paperback, hardcover, audiobook.  A quick search could reveal a PDF version with bookmarks (though I cannot directly endorse illegal downloads).  2.  **""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman:**      *   **Why it changed my thinking:** This book delves into the cognitive biases that influence our decisions, revealing that our brains operate on two systems of thinking: a fast, intuitive system (System 1) and a slow, analytical system (System 2). Understanding these systems has made me more aware of my own irrationality and the ways in which our minds are easily tricked. It has improved my critical thinking and decision-making.     *   **Considerations for a book club:** Great for discussions about biases, heuristics, and how we can improve our thinking processes. It also provides practical applications for daily life.     *   **Accessibility:**  A hugely popular book, readily available in print, ebook, and audiobook formats. Again, look for PDFs with bookmarks; some libraries may offer free digital copies.  3.  **""The Art of Learning: An Inner Journey to Optimal Performance"" by Josh Waitzkin:**      *   **Why it changed my thinking:** Waitzkin is a chess prodigy and martial artist. This book explores his principles of learning and personal growth. It's less about a specific subject matter and more about **how** to learn, adapt, and perform under pressure. It's influenced my approach to everything from my own skills acquisition to understanding people in various areas of study.     *   **Considerations for a book club:**  It's an inspirational read, and the principles are applicable to a wide range of fields. It prompts discussions about resilience, deliberate practice, and embracing failure.     *   **Accessibility:**  Widely available in print, ebook, and audiobook formats.  **To make it relevant to your provided context:**  *   **The ""now free, with corrections and bookmarks (for pdf)"" prompt likely refers to a book that is in the public domain (or has become free in some other way), and which is now readily available in a more user-friendly, digital format.** This is a great starting point for finding common ground.
