Summarize the abstract of a paper 'Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing: A Survey'.,"Over the last several years, the field of natural language processing has been propelled forward by an explosion in the use of deep learning models. This survey provides a brief introduction to the field and a quick overview of deep learning architectures and methods. It then sifts through the plethora of recent studies and summarizes a large assortment of relevant contributions. Analyzed research areas include several core linguistic processing issues in addition to a number of applications of computational linguistics. A discussion of the current state of the art is then provided along with recommendations for future research in the field.","In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by enabling the development of models that can learn complex representations of language data, leading to significant improvements in performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. Deep learning models for NLP typically use large amounts of data to train deep neural networks, allowing them to learn the patterns and relationships in language data. This is in contrast to traditional NLP approaches, which rely on hand-engineered features and rules to perform NLP tasks. The ability of deep neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of language data, handle variable-length input sequences, and perform well on large datasets makes them well-suited for NLP applications. Driven by the exponential growth of textual data and the increasing demand for condensed, coherent, and informative summaries, text summarization has been a critical research area in the field of NLP. Applying deep learning to text summarization refers to the use of deep neural networks to perform text summarization tasks. In this survey, we begin with a review of fashionable text summarization tasks in recent years, including extractive, abstractive, multi-document, and so on. Next, we discuss most deep learning-based models and their experimental results on these tasks. The paper also covers datasets and data representation for summarization tasks. Finally, we delve into the opportunities and challenges associated with summarization tasks and their corresponding methodologies, aiming to inspire future research efforts to advance the field further. A goal of our survey is to explain how these methods differ in their requirements as understanding them is essential for choosing a technique suited for a specific setting.","Deep learning methods employ multiple processing layers to learn hierarchical representations of data and have produced state-of-the-art results in many domains. Recently, a variety of model designs and methods have blossomed in the context of natural language processing (NLP). In this paper, we review significant deep learning related models and methods that have been employed for numerous NLP tasks and provide a walk-through of their evolution. We also summarize, compare and contrast the various models and put forward a detailed understanding of the past, present and future of deep learning in NLP."
Generate a detailed research question on the application of machine learning in climate modeling.,"Recent achievements in machine learning (Ml) have had a significant impact on various fields, including climate science. Climate modeling is very important and plays a crucial role in shaping the decisions of governments and individuals in mitigating the impact of climate change. Climate change poses a serious threat to humanity, however, current climate models are limited by computational costs, uncertainties, and biases, affecting their prediction accuracy. The vast amount of climate data generated by satellites, radars, and earth system models (ESMS) poses a significant challenge. ML techniques can be effectively employed to analyze this data and extract valuable insights that aid in our understanding of the earth climate. This review paper focuses on how ml has been utilized in the last 5 years to boost the current state-of-the-art climate models. We invite the ml community to join in the global effort to accurately model the earth climate by collaborating with other fields to leverage ml as a powerful tool in this endeavor.","Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as machine learning experts, may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how machine learning can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids to disaster management, we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by machine learning, in collaboration with other fields. Our recommendations encompass exciting research questions as well as promising business opportunities. We call on the machine learning community to join the global effort against climate change.","Modern weather and climate models share a common heritage, and often even components, however they are used in different ways to answer fundamentally different questions. As such, attempts to emulate them using machine learning should reflect this. While the use of machine learning to emulate weather forecast models is a relatively new endeavour there is a rich history of climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is an initial condition problem which intimately depends on the current state of the atmosphere, climate modelling is predominantly a boundary condition problem. In order to emulate the response of the climate to different drivers therefore, representation of the full dynamical evolution of the atmosphere is neither necessary, or in many cases, desirable. Climate scientists are typically interested in different questions also. Indeed emulating the steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g. parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the large datasets, non-linear relationships and limited training data make Climate a domain which is rich in interesting machine learning challenges. Here I seek to set out the current state of climate model emulation and demonstrate how, despite some challenges, recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for creating useful statistical models of the climate."
Give use of blockchain in supply chain management.,"Blockchain in supply chain management is expected to boom over the next five years. It is estimated that the global blockchain supply chain market would grow at a compound annual growth rate of 87% and increase from \$45 million in 2018 to \$3,314.6 million by 2023. Blockchain will improve business for all global supply chain stakeholders by providing enhanced traceability, facilitating digitisation, and securing chain-of-custody. This paper provides a synthesis of the existing challenges in global supply chain and trade operations, as well as the relevant capabilities and potential of blockchain. We further present leading pilot initiatives on applying blockchains to supply chains and the logistics industry to fulfill a range of needs. Finally, we discuss the implications of blockchain on customs and governmental agencies, summarize challenges in enabling the wide scale deployment of blockchain in global supply chain management, and identify future research directions.","Supply chain applications operate in a multi-stakeholder setting, demanding trust, provenance, and transparency. Blockchain technology provides mechanisms to establish a decentralized infrastructure involving multiple stakeholders. Such mechanisms make the blockchain technology ideal for multi-stakeholder supply chain applications. This chapter introduces the characteristics and requirements of the supply chain and explains how blockchain technology can meet the demands of supply chain applications. In particular, this chapter discusses how data and trust management can be established using blockchain technology. The importance of scalability and interoperability in a blockchain-based supply chain is highlighted to help the stakeholders make an informed decision. The chapter concludes by underscoring the design challenges and open opportunities in the blockchain-based supply chain domain.","Heretofore the concept of ""blockchain"" has not been precisely defined. Accordingly the potential useful applications of this technology have been largely inflated. This work sidesteps the question of what constitutes a blockchain as such and focuses on the architectural components of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, insofar as possible, in isolation. We consider common problems inherent in the design of effective supply chain management systems. With each identified problem we propose a solution that utilizes one or more component aspects of Bitcoin. This culminates in five design principles for increased efficiency in supply chain management systems through the application of incentive mechanisms and data structures native to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency protocol."
What are the best practices for creating a viral trend on Instagram?,"Social media generates a prodigious wealth of real-time content at an incessant rate. From all the content that people create and share, only a few topics manage to attract enough attention to rise to the top and become temporal trends which are displayed to users. The question of what factors cause the formation and persistence of trends is an important one that has not been answered yet. In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending topics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation, persistence and decay of trends. We also demonstrate empirically how factors such as user activity and number of followers do not contribute strongly to trend creation and its propagation. In fact, we find that the resonance of the content with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing trends.","In addition to more personalized content feeds, some leading social media platforms give a prominent role to content that is more widely popular. On Twitter, ""trending topics"" identify popular topics of conversation on the platform, thereby promoting popular content which users might not have otherwise seen through their network. Hence, ""trending topics"" potentially play important roles in influencing the topics users engage with on a particular day. Using two carefully constructed data sets from India and Turkey, we study the effects of a hashtag appearing on the trending topics page on the number of tweets produced with that hashtag. We specifically aim to answer the question: How many new tweeting using that hashtag appear because a hashtag is labeled as trending? We distinguish the effects of the trending topics page from network exposure and find there is a statistically significant, but modest, return to a hashtag being featured on trending topics. Analysis of the types of users impacted by trending topics shows that the feature helps less popular and new users to discover and spread content outside their network, which they otherwise might not have been able to do.","Searching for influential spreaders in complex networks is an issue of great significance for applications across various domains, ranging from the epidemic control, innovation diffusion, viral marketing, social movement to idea propagation. In this paper, we first display some of the most important theoretical models that describe spreading processes, and then discuss the problem of locating both the individual and multiple influential spreaders respectively. Recent approaches in these two topics are presented. For the identification of privileged single spreaders, we summarize several widely used centralities, such as degree, betweenness centrality, PageRank, k-shell, etc. We investigate the empirical diffusion data in a large scale online social community -- LiveJournal. With this extensive dataset, we find that various measures can convey very distinct information of nodes. Of all the users in LiveJournal social network, only a small fraction of them involve in spreading. For the spreading processes in LiveJournal, while degree can locate nodes participating in information diffusion with higher probability, k-shell is more effective in finding nodes with large influence. Our results should provide useful information for designing efficient spreading strategies in reality."
Create a LinkedIn post highlighting the benefits of social media marketing for small businesses.,"We explore what benefits network position in online business social networks like LinkedIn might confer to an aspiring entrepreneur. We compare two network attributes, size and embeddedness, and two actor attributes, location and diversity, between virtual and real-world networks. The promise of social networks like LinkedIn is that network friends enable easier access to critical resources such as legal and financial services, customers, and business partners. Our setting consists of one million public member profiles of the German business networking site XING (a German version of LinkedIn) from which we extracted the network structure of 15,000 start-up entrepreneurs from 12 large German universities. We find no positive effect of virtual network size and embeddedness, and small positive effects of location and diversity.","Nowadays social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.), not only simply as communication media, but also for promotion. Social networking media offers many business benefits for companies and organizations. Research purposes is to determine the model of social network media utilization as a promotional media for handicraft business in Palembang city. Qualitative and quantitative research design are used to know how handicraft business in Palembang city utilizing social media networking as a promotional media. The research results show 35% craft businesses already utilizing social media as a promotional media. The social media used are blog development 15%, facebook 46%, and twitter etc. are 39%. The reasons they use social media such as, 1) minimal cost, 2) easily recognizable, 3) global distribution areas. Social media emphasis on direct engagement with customers better. So that the marketing method could be more personal through direct communication with customers.","Viral marketing is different from other marketing strategies since it leverages the influence power in intimate relationship, e.g., close friends, family members, couples. Due to the development and popularity of social networking services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, the new notion of ""social media marketing"" has appeared in recent years and presents new opportunities for enabling large-scale and prevalent viral marketing online. To boost the growth of their sales, business is embracing social media in a big way. According to USA Today, the sales of software to run corporate social networks will grow 61\% a year and be a $6.4$ billion business by 2016."
Describe the key elements that make a motivational speech impactful for a global audience.,"One problem that every presenter faces when delivering a public discourse is how to hold the listeners' attentions or to keep them involved. Therefore, many studies in conversation analysis work on this issue and suggest qualitatively con-structions that can effectively lead to audience's applause. To investigate these proposals quantitatively, in this study we an-alyze the transcripts of 2,135 TED Talks, with a particular fo-cus on the rhetorical devices that are used by the presenters for applause elicitation. Through conducting regression anal-ysis, we identify and interpret 24 rhetorical devices as triggers of audience applauding. We further build models that can rec-ognize applause-evoking sentences and conclude this work with potential implications.","The growing prevalence of conversational voice interfaces, powered by developments in both speech and language technologies, raises important questions about their influence on human communication. While written communication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices, voice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as accent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social identity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such as television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike passive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and reciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals speak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to arise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic accommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to adapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is still emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations, movements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and controlling public perception and social identity. We argue that the socioindexical influence of AI-generated speech warrants attention and should become a focus of interdisciplinary research, leveraging new and existing methodologies and technologies to better understand its implications.","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable and prevalent, and can be used to produce creative content. The quality of content is influenced by the prompt used, with more specific prompts that incorporate examples generally producing better results. On from this, it could be seen that using instructions written for crowdsourcing tasks (that are specific and include examples to guide workers) could prove effective LLM prompts. To explore this, we used a previous crowdsourcing pipeline that gave examples to people to help them generate a collectively diverse corpus of motivational messages. We then used this same pipeline to generate messages using GPT-4, and compared the collective diversity of messages from: (1) crowd-writers, (2) GPT-4 using the pipeline, and (3 & 4) two baseline GPT-4 prompts. We found that the LLM prompts using the crowdsourcing pipeline caused GPT-4 to produce more diverse messages than the two baseline prompts. We also discuss implications from messages generated by both human writers and LLMs."
Generate a detailed introduction for a talk on the importance of diversity.,Reflecting on the beauty of diversity in our world.,"These proceedings accompany the Belle II talk in the Diversity and Inclusion parallel session delivered during ICHEP 2020. This marks the first external presentation by the Belle II Collaboration, in which we present some of our data and self-reported statistics regarding diversity and inclusion. We also present Belle II's current and planned activities to aid and improve diversity and inclusion. We find that there is still a lot to be done to improve the social working environment and population representation within our collaboration and within high energy physics","Diversity indices are useful single-number metrics for characterizing a complex distribution of a set of attributes across a population of interest. The utility of these different metrics or sets of metrics depend on the context and application, and whether a predictive mechanistic model exists. In this topical review, we first summarize the relevant mathematical principles underlying heterogeneity in a large population before outlining the various definitions of `diversity' and providing examples of scientific topics in which its quantification plays an important role. We then review how diversity has been a ubiquitous concept across multiple fields including ecology, immunology, cellular barcoding experiments, and socioeconomic studies. Since many of these applications involve sampling of populations, we also review how diversity in small samples is related to the diversity in the entire population. Features that arise in each of these applications are highlighted."
How can a speaker use storytelling to make a talk on mental health more relatable to the audience?,"Stories about overcoming personal struggles can effectively illustrate the application of psychological theories in real life, yet they may fail to resonate with individuals' experiences. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to create tailored narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals. Our study, involving 346 young adults across two settings, demonstrates that personalized LLM-enhanced stories were perceived to be better than human-written ones in conveying key takeaways, promoting reflection, and reducing belief in negative thoughts. These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.","Immersive stories for health are 360-degree videos that intend to alter viewer perceptions about behaviors detrimental to health. They have potential to inform public health at scale, however, immersive story design is still in early stages and largely devoid of best practices. This paper presents a focus group study with 147 viewers of an immersive story about binge drinking experienced through VR headsets and mobile phones. The objective of the study is to identify aspects of immersive story design that influence attitudes towards the health issue exhibited, and to understand how health information is consumed in immersive stories. Findings emphasize the need for an immersive story to provide reasoning behind character engagement in the focal health behavior, to show the main character clearly engaging in the behavior, and to enable viewers to experience escalating symptoms of the behavior before the penultimate health consequence. Findings also show how the design of supporting characters can inadvertently distract viewers and lead them to justify the detrimental behavior being exhibited. The paper concludes with design considerations for enabling immersive stories to better inform public perception of health issues.","Individuals with severe mental illnesses (SMI), particularly schizophrenia, experience complex and intense emotions frequently. They increasingly turn to vlogging as an authentic medium for emotional disclosure and online support-seeking. While previous research has primarily focused on text-based disclosure, little is known about how people construct narratives around emotions and emotional experiences through video blogs. Our study analyzed 401 YouTube videos created by schizophrenia vloggers, revealing that vloggers disclosed their fear, sadness, and joy through verbal narration by explicit expressions or storytelling. Visually, they employed various framing styles, including Anonymous, Talk-to-Camera, and In-the-Moment approaches, along with diverse visual narration techniques. Notably, we uncovered a concerning 'visual appeal disparity' in audience engagement, with visually appealing videos receiving significantly more views, likes, and comments. This study discusses the role of video-sharing platforms in emotional expression and offers design implications for fostering online care-seeking for emotionally vulnerable populations."
How can social media platforms detect and mitigate the spread of hateful content in user posts?,"The present online social media platform is afflicted with several issues, with hate speech being on the predominant forefront. The prevalence of online hate speech has fueled horrific real-world hate-crime such as the mass-genocide of Rohingya Muslims, communal violence in Colombo and the recent massacre in the Pittsburgh synagogue. Consequently, It is imperative to understand the diffusion of such hateful content in an online setting. We conduct the first study that analyses the flow and dynamics of posts generated by hateful and non-hateful users on Gab (gab.com) over a massive dataset of 341K users and 21M posts. Our observations confirms that hateful content diffuse farther, wider and faster and have a greater outreach than those of non-hateful users. A deeper inspection into the profiles and network of hateful and non-hateful users reveals that the former are more influential, popular and cohesive. Thus, our research explores the interesting facets of diffusion dynamics of hateful users and broadens our understanding of hate speech in the online world.","Communication on social media platforms is not only culturally and politically relevant, it is also increasingly widespread across societies. Users not only communicate via social media platforms, but also search specifically for information, disseminate it or post information themselves. However, fake news, hate speech and even radicalizing elements are part of this modern form of communication: Sometimes with far-reaching effects on individuals and societies. A basic understanding of these mechanisms and communication patterns could help to counteract negative forms of communication, e.g. bullying among children or extreme political points of view. To this end, a method will be presented in order to break down the underlying communication patterns, to trace individual users and to inspect their comments and range on social media platforms; Or to contrast them later on via qualitative research. This approeach can identify particularly active users with an accuracy of 100 percent, if the framing social networks as well as the topics are taken into account. However, methodological as well as counteracting approaches must be even more dynamic and flexible to ensure sensitivity and specifity regarding users who spread hate speech, fake news and radicalizing elements.","The rapid integration of the Internet into our daily lives has led to many benefits but also to a number of new, wide-spread threats such as online hate, trolling, bullying, and generally aggressive behaviours. While research has traditionally explored online hate, in particular, on one platform, the reality is that such hate is a phenomenon that often makes use of multiple online networks. In this article, we seek to advance the discussion into online hate by harnessing a comparative approach, where we make use of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to computationally analyse hateful content from Reddit and 4chan relating to the 2020 US Presidential Elections. Our findings show how content and posting activity can differ depending on the platform being used. Through this, we provide initial comparison into the platform-specific behaviours of online hate, and how different platforms can serve specific purposes. We further provide several avenues for future research utilising a cross-platform approach so as to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the global hate ecosystem."
How can a social media platform encourage user engagement on posts about environmental awareness?,"Social media is now the predominant source of information due to the availability of immediate public response. As a result, social media data has become a valuable resource for comprehending public sentiments. Studies have shown that it can amplify ideas and influence public sentiments. This study analyzes the public perception of climate change and the environment over a decade from 2014 to 2023. Using the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) algorithm, we identify sentiment and explore prevailing emotions expressed within environmental tweets across various social media platforms, namely Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. Accuracy on a human-annotated dataset was 0.65, higher than Vader score but lower than that of an expert rater (0.90). Our findings suggest that negative environmental tweets are far more common than positive or neutral ones. Climate change, air quality, emissions, plastic, and recycling are the most discussed topics on all social media platforms, highlighting its huge global concern. The most common emotions in environmental tweets are fear, trust, and anticipation, demonstrating public reactions wide and complex nature. By identifying patterns and trends in opinions related to the environment, we hope to provide insights that can help raise awareness regarding environmental issues, inform the development of interventions, and adapt further actions to meet environmental challenges.","Social media is very popular for facilitating conversations about important topics and bringing forth insights and issues related to these topics. Reddit serves as a platform that fosters social interactions and hosts engaging discussions on a wide array of topics, thus forming narratives around these topics. One such topic is climate change. There are extensive discussions on Reddit about climate change, indicating high interest in its various aspects. In this paper, we explore 11 subreddits that discuss climate change for the duration of 2014 to 2022 and conduct a data-driven analysis of the posts on these subreddits. We present a basic characterization of the data and show the distribution of the posts and authors across our dataset for all years. Additionally, we analyze user engagement metrics like scores for the posts and how they change over time. We also offer insights into the topics of discussion across the subreddits, followed by entities referenced throughout the dataset","Researchers are developing mobile sensing platforms to facilitate public awareness of environmental conditions. However, turning such awareness into practical community action and political change requires more than just collecting and presenting data. To inform research on mobile environmental sensing, we conducted design fieldwork with government, private, and public interest stakeholders. In parallel, we built an environmental air quality sensing system and deployed it on street sweeping vehicles in a major U.S. city; this served as a ""research vehicle"" by grounding our interviews and affording us status as environmental action researchers. In this paper, we present a qualitative analysis of the landscape of environmental action, focusing on insights that will help researchers frame meaningful technological interventions."
What emotional tone inspires action in social issue posts?,"Social media platforms have emerged as prominent information sharing ecosystems in the context of a variety of recent crises, ranging from mass emergencies, to wars and political conflicts. We study affective responses in social media and how they might indicate desensitization to violence experienced in communities embroiled in an armed conflict. Specifically, we examine three established affect measures: negative affect, activation, and dominance as observed on Twitter in relation to a number of statistics on protracted violence in four major cities afflicted by the Mexican Drug War. During a two year period (Aug 2010-Dec 2012), while violence was on the rise in these regions, our findings show a decline in negative emotional expression as well as a rise in emotional arousal and dominance in Twitter posts: aspects known to be psychological markers of desensitization. We discuss the implications of our work for behavioral health, facilitating rehabilitation efforts in communities enmeshed in an acute and persistent urban warfare, and the impact on civic engagement.","Emotions play an important role in interpersonal interactions and social conflict, yet their function in the development of controversy and disagreement in online conversations has not been explored. To address this gap, we study controversy on Reddit, a popular network of online discussion forums. We collect discussions from a wide variety of topical forums and use emotion detection to recognize a range of emotions from text, including anger, fear, joy, admiration, etc. Our study has three main findings. First, controversial comments express more anger and less admiration, joy and optimism than non-controversial comments. Second, controversial comments affect emotions of downstream comments in a discussion, usually resulting in long-term increase in anger and a decrease in positive emotions, although the magnitude and direction of emotional change depends on the forum. Finally, we show that emotions help better predict which comments will become controversial. Understanding emotional dynamics of online discussions can help communities to better manage conversations.","Recent decades have witnessed online social media being a big-data window for quantificationally testifying conventional social theories and exploring much detailed human behavioral patterns. In this paper, by tracing the emoticon use in Weibo, a group of hidden ""ambivalent users"" are disclosed for frequently posting ambivalent tweets containing both positive and negative emotions. Further investigation reveals that this ambivalent expression could be a novel indicator of many unusual social behaviors. For instance, ambivalent users with the female as the majority like to make a sound in midnights or at weekends. They mention their close friends frequently in ambivalent tweets, which attract more replies and thus serve as a more private communication way. Ambivalent users also respond differently to public affairs from others and demonstrate more interests in entertainment and sports events. Moreover, the sentiment shift of words adopted in ambivalent tweets is more evident than usual and exhibits a clear ""negative to positive"" pattern. The above observations, though being promiscuous seemingly, actually point to the self regulation of negative mood in Weibo, which could find its base from the emotion management theories in sociology but makes an interesting extension to the online environment. Finally, as an interesting corollary, ambivalent users are found connected with compulsive buyers and turn out to be perfect targets for online marketing."
How can sentiment analysis be used to understand public reactions to a new product launch?,"In this study, we leverage state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. By employing transformer-based models, RoBERTa, we analyze a vast dataset to derive sentiment scores that accurately reflect the emotional tones of the reviews. We provide an in-depth explanation of the underlying principles of these models and evaluate their performance in generating sentiment scores. Further, we conduct comprehensive data analysis and visualization to identify patterns and trends in sentiment scores, examining their alignment with behavioral economics principles such as electronic word of mouth (eWOM), consumer emotional reactions, and the confirmation bias. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of advanced NLP models in sentiment analysis and offer valuable insights into consumer behavior, with implications for strategic decision-making and marketing practices.","The advancement of text generation models has granted us the capability to produce coherent and convincing text on demand. Yet, in real-life circumstances, individuals do not continuously generate text or voice their opinions. For instance, consumers pen product reviews after weighing the merits and demerits of a product, and professional analysts issue reports following significant news releases. In essence, opinion expression is typically prompted by particular reasons or signals. Despite long-standing developments in opinion mining, the appropriate timing for expressing an opinion remains largely unexplored. To address this deficit, our study introduces an innovative task - the identification of news-triggered opinion expressing timing. We ground this task in the actions of professional stock analysts and develop a novel dataset for investigation. Our approach is decision-focused, leveraging text generation models to steer the classification model, thus enhancing overall performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the text generated by our model contributes fresh insights from various angles, effectively aiding in identifying the optimal timing for opinion expression.","Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest spreading research areas in computer science, making it challenging to keep track of all the activities in the area. We present a customer feedback reviews on product, where we utilize opinion mining, text mining and sentiments, which has affected the surrounded world by changing their opinion on a specific product. Data used in this study are online product reviews collected from Amazon.com. We performed a comparative sentiment analysis of retrieved reviews. This research paper provides you with sentimental analysis of various smart phone opinions on smart phones dividing them Positive, Negative and Neutral Behaviour."
What are the best strategies for creating engaging content on Twitter for a tech company?,"140 characters seems like too small a space for any meaningful information to be exchanged, but Twitter users have found creative ways to get the most out of each Tweet by using different communication tools. This paper looks into how 73 nonprofit organizations use Twitter to engage stakeholders not only through their tweets, but also through other various communication methods. Specifically, it looks into the organizations' utilization of tweet frequency, following behavior, hyperlinks, hashtags, public messages, retweets, and multimedia files. After analyzing 4,655 tweets, the study found that the nation's largest nonprofits are not using Twitter to maximize stakeholder involvement. Instead, they continue to use social media as a one-way communication channel, as less than 20% of their total tweets demonstrate conversations and roughly 16% demonstrate indirect connections to specific users.","Twitter is a micro-blogging social media platform for short messages that can have a long-term impact on how scientists create and publish ideas. We investigate the usefulness of twitter in the development and distribution of scientific knowledge. At the start of the life cycle of a scientific publication, twitter provides a large virtual department of colleagues that can help to rapidly generate, share and refine new ideas. As ideas become manuscripts, twitter can be used as an informal arena for the pre-review of works in progress. Finally, tweeting published findings can communicate research to a broad audience of other researchers, decision makers, journalists and the general public that can amplify the scientific and social impact of publications. However, there are limitations, largely surrounding issues of intellectual property and ownership, inclusiveness and misrepresentations of science sound bites. Nevertheless, we believe twitter is a useful social media tool that can provide a valuable contribution to scientific publishing in the 21st century.","Collecting good ideas is vital for organizations, especially companies, to retain their competitiveness. Social media is gathering attention as a place to extract ideas efficiently; however, the characteristics of ideas and the posters of ideas on social media are underexamined. Thus, this study aims to characterize spontaneous ideation contests among social media users by taking an event of Facebook's name change to Meta as a case study. As a dataset, we comprehensively collect tweets containing new acronyms of Big Tech companies, which we treat as an ""idea"" in this work. In the analysis, we especially focus on the diversity of ideas, which would be the main reason for enlisting social media for idea generation. As the main results, we discovered that social media users offered a wider range of ideas than those in mainstream media. The follow-follower network of the users suggested that the users' position on the network is related to the preferred ideas. Additionally, we discovered a link between the amount of user interaction on social media and the diversity of ideas. This study would promote the use of social media as a part of open innovation and co-creation processes in the industry."
How can a small business effectively build a loyal customer base?,"Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are very common in large companies. However, CRM systems are not very common in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Most SMEs do not implement CRM systems due to several reasons, such as lack of knowledge about CRM or lack of financial resources to implement CRM systems. SMEs have to start implementing Information Systems (IS) technology into their business operations in order to improve business values and gain more competitive advantage over rivals. CRM system has the potential to help improve the business value and competitive capabilities of SMEs. Given the high fixed costs of normal activity of companies, we intend to promote free and viable solutions for small and medium businesses. In this paper, we explain the reasons why SMEs do not implement CRM system and the benefits of using open source CRM system in SMEs. We also describe the functionalities of top open source CRM systems, examining the applicability of these tools in fitting the needs of SMEs.","Considering a supply chain with partial vertical integration, we attempt to seek answers to several questions related to the cooperation competition based friction, abundant in such networks. Such an SC can represent a supplier with an inhouse production unit that attempts to control an outhouse production unit via the said friction. The two production units can have different sets of loyal customer bases and the aim of the manufacturer supplier duo would be to get the best out of the two customer bases. Our analysis shows that under certain market conditions, an optimal strategy might be to allow both units to earn positive profits particularly when they hold similar market power and when customer loyalty is high. In cases of weaker customer loyalty, however, the optimal approach may involve pressurizing the outhouse unit to operate at minimal profits. Even more intriguing is the scenario where the outhouse unit has a greater market power and customer loyalty remains strong here, it may be optimal for the inhouse unit to operate at a loss just enough to dismantle the downstream monopoly.","This study tries to examine the influence of salesperson's customer orientation on customer loyalty. Customer orientation is the approach taken by a salesperson to improve customer relationship and increase sales. Many organizations prefer sales orientation as a strategic approach towards increasing sales. Though successful in its objective, sales orientation fails to attract repetitive purchase. It has become a necessity to train frontline employees to better understand the customer needs, keeping in mind the firm's ultimate objective. This study examines the improvements customer orientation can bring to increase repurchases thus leading to customer loyalty. The findings suggest that product assortment, long lines of customers, customers' annual income, and the listening skills of salesperson were the significant antecedents of customer loyalty."
How can someone share their enthusiasm for a new book release ?,New book release from my favorite author!,Excitement for a quiet evening with a good book.,"Finding enjoyable fiction books can be challenging, partly because stories are multi-faceted and one's own literary taste might be difficult to ascertain. Here, we introduce the ISAAC method (Introspection-Support, AI-Annotation, and Curation), a pipeline which supports fiction readers in gaining awareness of their literary preferences and finding enjoyable books. ISAAC consists of four steps: a user supplies book ratings, an AI agent researches and annotates the provided books, patterns in book enjoyment are reviewed by the user, and the AI agent recommends new books. In this proof-of-concept self-study, the authors test whether ISAAC can highlight idiosyncratic patterns in their book enjoyment, spark a deeper reflection about their literary tastes, and make accurate, personalized recommendations of enjoyable books and underexplored literary niches. Results highlight substantial advantages of ISAAC over existing methods such as an integration of automation and intuition, accurate and customizable annotations, and explainable book recommendations. Observed disadvantages are that ISAAC's outputs can elicit false self-narratives (if statistical patterns are taken at face value), that books cannot be annotated if their online documentation is lacking, and that people who are new to reading have to rely on assumed book ratings or movie ratings to power the ISAAC pipeline. We discuss additional opportunities of ISAAC-style book annotations for the study of literary trends, and the scientific classification of books and readers."
How can a user promote a virtual cooking class to attract participants?,"This paper presents the designing and testing of PizzaBox, a 3D printed, interactive food ordering system that aims to differ from conventional food ordering systems and provide an entertaining and unique experience when ordering a pizza by incorporating underlying technologies that support ubiquitous computing. The PizzaBox has gone through both low and medium fidelity testing while working collaboratively with participants to co-design and refine a product that is approachable to all age groups while maintaining a simple process for ordering food from start to finish. Final testing was conducted at an independent pizzeria where interviews with participants lead us to develop four discussion themes 1) usability and end user engagement, 2) towards connected real-time products and services, 3) healthy eating, 4) evolution of food ordering systems. Our interviews show that in general, PizzaBox would have a greater appeal to a younger audience by providing a fantasy of helping in the creation and baking of the pizza but also has a novelty value that all ages would enjoy. We investigate the effect that the PizzaBox has in encouraging new healthy habits or promoting a healthier lifestyle as well as how we can improve PizzaBox to better encourage these lifestyle changes.","Climate change education often struggles to bridge the perception gap between everyday actions and their long-term environmental consequences. In response, we developed Meltdown, an immersive virtual reality (VR) escape room that simulates a grocery shopping and food waste management experience to educate university students in Singapore about sustainable consumption. The game emphasizes sustainable food choices and disposal practices, combining interactive elements and narrative feedback to promote behavioral change. Through a user study with 36 university students, we observed statistically significant improvements in participants objective knowledge, perceived confidence, and intention to adopt sustainable behaviors. Our results suggest that experiential VR environments can enhance climate education by making abstract environmental concepts more immediate and personally relevant.","The recommendation of food items is important for many reasons. Attaining cooking inspiration via digital sources is becoming evermore popular; as are systems, which recommend other types of food, such as meals in restaurants or products in supermarkets. Researchers have been studying these kinds of systems for many years, suggesting not only that can they be a means to help people find food they might want to eat, but also help them nourish themselves more healthily. This paper provides a summary of the state-of-the-art of so-called food recommender systems, highlighting both seminal and most recent approaches to the problem, as well as important specializations, such as food recommendation systems for groups of users or systems which promote healthy eating. We moreover discuss the diverse challenges involved in designing recsys for food, summarise the lessons learned from past research and outline what we believe to be important future directions and open questions for the field. In providing these contributions we hope to provide a useful resource for researchers and practitioners alike."
Why would a user hide their identity in a sensitive online discussion?,"In communities with social hierarchies, fear of judgment can discourage communication. While anonymity may alleviate some social pressure, fully anonymous spaces enable toxic behavior and hide the social context that motivates people to participate and helps them tailor their communication. We explore a design space of meronymous communication, where people can reveal carefully chosen aspects of their identity and also leverage trusted endorsers to gain credibility. We implemented these ideas in a system for scholars to meronymously seek and receive paper recommendations on Twitter and Mastodon. A formative study with 20 scholars confirmed that scholars see benefits to participating but are deterred due to social anxiety. From a month-long public deployment, we found that with meronymity, junior scholars could comfortably ask ``newbie'' questions and get responses from senior scholars who they normally found intimidating. Responses were also tailored to the aspects about themselves that junior scholars chose to reveal.","Social media platforms (SMPs) facilitate information sharing across varying levels of sensitivity. A crucial design decision for SMP administrators is the platform's identity policy, with some opting for real-name systems while others allow anonymous participation. Content moderation on these platforms is conducted by both humans and automated bots. This paper examines the relationship between anonymity, specifically through the use of ``throwaway'' accounts, and the extent and nature of content moderation on Reddit. Our findings indicate that content originating from anonymous throwaway accounts is more likely to violate rules on Reddit. Thus, they are more likely to be removed by moderation than standard pseudonymous accounts. However, the moderation actions applied to throwaway accounts are consistent with those applied to ordinary accounts, suggesting that the use of anonymous accounts does not necessarily necessitate increased human moderation. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for identity policies and content moderation strategies on SMPs.","Anonymity forms an integral and important part of our digital life. It enables us to express our true selves without the fear of judgment. In this paper, we investigate the different aspects of anonymity in the social Q&A site Quora. The choice of Quora is motivated by the fact that this is one of the rare social Q&A sites that allow users to explicitly post anonymous questions and such activity in this forum has become normative rather than a taboo. Through an analysis of 5.1 million questions, we observe that at a global scale almost no difference manifests between the linguistic structure of the anonymous and the non-anonymous questions. We find that topical mixing at the global scale to be the primary reason for the absence. However, the differences start to feature once we ""deep dive"" and (topically) cluster the questions and compare the clusters that have high volumes of anonymous questions with those that have low volumes of anonymous questions. In particular, we observe that the choice to post the question as anonymous is dependent on the user's perception of anonymity and they often choose to speak about depression, anxiety, social ties and personal issues under the guise of anonymity. We further perform personality trait analysis and observe that the anonymous group of users has positive correlation with extraversion, agreeableness, and negative correlation with openness. Subsequently, to gain further insights, we build an anonymity grid to identify the differences in the perception on anonymity of the user posting the question and the community of users answering it. We also look into the first response time of the questions and observe that it is lowest for topics which talk about personal and sensitive issues, which hints toward a higher degree of community support and user engagement."
What risks come from debating online without clear community guidelines?,"Online discussion moderators must make ad-hoc decisions about whether the contributions of discussion participants are appropriate or should be removed to maintain civility. Existing research on offensive language and the resulting tools cover only one aspect among many involved in such decisions. The question of what is considered appropriate in a controversial discussion has not yet been systematically addressed. In this paper, we operationalize appropriate language in argumentation for the first time. In particular, we model appropriateness through the absence of flaws, grounded in research on argument quality assessment, especially in aspects from rhetoric. From these, we derive a new taxonomy of 14 dimensions that determine inappropriate language in online discussions. Building on three argument quality corpora, we then create a corpus of 2191 arguments annotated for the 14 dimensions. Empirical analyses support that the taxonomy covers the concept of appropriateness comprehensively, showing several plausible correlations with argument quality dimensions. Moreover, results of baseline approaches to assessing appropriateness suggest that all dimensions can be modeled computationally on the corpus.","Online debates can enhance critical thinking but may escalate into hostile attacks. As humans are increasingly reliant on Generative AI (GenAI) in writing tasks, we need to understand how people utilize GenAI in online debates. To examine the patterns of writing behavior while making arguments with GenAI, we created an online forum for soccer fans to engage in turn-based and free debates in a post format with the assistance of ChatGPT, arguing on the topic of ""Messi vs Ronaldo"". After 13 sessions of two-part study and semi-structured interviews with 39 participants, we conducted content and thematic analyses to integrate insights from interview transcripts, ChatGPT records, and forum posts. We found that participants prompted ChatGPT for aggressive responses, created posts with similar content and logical fallacies, and sacrificed the use of ChatGPT for better human-human communication. This work uncovers how polarized forum members work with GenAI to engage in debates online.","Terms like 'misinformation', 'fake news', and 'echo chambers' permeate current discussions on the state of the Internet. We believe a lack of technological support to evaluate, contest, and reason about information online---as opposed to merely disseminating it---lies at the root of these problems. Several argument technologies support such functionality, but have seen limited use outside of niche communities. Most research systems overemphasize argument analysis and structure, standing in stark contrast with the informal dialectical nature of everyday argumentation. Conversely, non-academic systems overlook important implications for design which can be derived from theory. In this paper, we present the design of a system aiming to strike a balance between structured argumentation and ease of use. Socratrees is a website for collaborative argumentative discussion targeting layman users, but includes sophisticated community guidelines and novel features inspired by informal logic. During an exploratory study, we evaluate the usefulness of our imposed structure on argumentation and investigate how users perceive it. Contributing to arguments remains a complex task, but most users learned to do so effectively with minimal guidance and all recognized that the structure of Socratrees may improve online discussion and results in a clearer overview of arguments."

What are some creative ways to photograph food for an Instagram post?,"What we eat is one of the most frequent and important health decisions we make in daily life, yet it remains notoriously difficult to capture and understand. Effective food journaling is thus a grand challenge in personal health informatics. In this paper we describe a system for food journaling called I Ate This, which is inspired by the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM). I Ate This is simple: you use a smartphone app to take a photo and give a very basic description of any food or beverage you are about to consume. Later, a qualified dietitian will evaluate your photo, giving you feedback on how you did and where you can improve. The aim of I Ate This is to provide a convenient, visual and reliable way to help users learn from their eating habits and nudge them towards better choices each and every day. Ultimately, this incremental approach can lead to long-term behaviour change. Our goal is to bring RFPM to a wider audience, through APIs that can be incorporated into other apps.","The pervasiveness of mobile cameras has resulted in a dramatic increase in food photos, which are pictures reflecting what people eat. In this paper, we study how taking pictures of what we eat in restaurants can be used for the purpose of automating food journaling. We propose to leverage the context of where the picture was taken, with additional information about the restaurant, available online, coupled with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to recognize the food being consumed. To this end, we demonstrate image-based recognition of foods eaten in restaurants by training a classifier with images from restaurant's online menu databases. We evaluate the performance of our system in unconstrained, real-world settings with food images taken in 10 restaurants across 5 different types of food (American, Indian, Italian, Mexican and Thai).","People enjoy food photography because they appreciate food. Behind each meal there is a story described in a complex recipe and, unfortunately, by simply looking at a food image we do not have access to its preparation process. Therefore, in this paper we introduce an inverse cooking system that recreates cooking recipes given food images. Our system predicts ingredients as sets by means of a novel architecture, modeling their dependencies without imposing any order, and then generates cooking instructions by attending to both image and its inferred ingredients simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the whole system on the large-scale Recipe1M dataset and show that (1) we improve performance w.r.t. previous baselines for ingredient prediction; (2) we are able to obtain high quality recipes by leveraging both image and ingredients; (3) our system is able to produce more compelling recipes than retrieval-based approaches according to human judgment. We make code and models publicly available."
Give tips for building a strong personal brand.,"Providing appealing brand names to newly launched products, newly formed companies or for renaming existing companies is highly important as it can play a crucial role in deciding its success or failure. In this work, we propose a computational method to generate appealing brand names based on the description of such entities. We use quantitative scores for readability, pronounceability, memorability and uniqueness of the generated names to rank order them. A set of diverse appealing names is recommended to the user for the brand naming task. Experimental results show that the names generated by our approach are more appealing than names which prior approaches and recruited humans could come up.","The environmental conservation issue has led consumers to rethink the products they purchase. Nowadays, many consumers are willing to pay more for products that genuinely adhere to environmental standards to support the environment. Consequently, concepts like green marketing have gradually infiltrated marketing literature, making environmental considerations one of the most important activities for companies. Accordingly, this research investigates the impacts of green marketing strategy on perceived brand quality (case study: food exporting companies). The study population comprises 345 employees and managers from companies such as Kalleh, Solico, Pemina, Sorbon, Mac, Pol, and Casel. Using Cochran's formula, a sample of 182 individuals was randomly selected. This research is practical; the required data were collected through surveys and questionnaires. The findings indicate that (1) green marketing strategy has a significant positive effect on perceived brand quality, (2) green products have a significant positive effect on perceived brand quality, (3) green promotion has a significant positive effect on perceived brand quality, (4) green distribution has a significant positive effect on perceived brand quality, and (5) green pricing has a significant positive effect on perceived brand quality.","The aim of the study is to determine the effect of the brand on purchasing decision on generation Y. For this purpose, a face-to-face survey was conducted with 231 people in the Y age range who have purchased mobile phones in the last year. The study was conducted with young academicians and university students working in Harran University Vocational High Schools. The collected data were analysed with AMOS and SPSS statistical package programs using structural equation modelling. According to the results of the research, the prestige, name and reliability of the brand have a significant impact on the purchase decision of the Y generation. Price, advertising campaigns and technical services of the brand also affect this decision less. On the other hand, the place where mobile phone brands are produced and the importance they attach to social responsibility projects do not affect the purchasing decision."
How do I explain a complex topic in a simple and engaging way?,"COMPLEX-IT is a case-based, mixed-methods platform for social inquiry into complex data/systems, designed to increase non-expert access to the tools of computational social science (i.e., cluster analysis, artificial intelligence, data visualization, data forecasting, and scenario simulation). In particular, COMPLEX-IT aids social inquiry though a heavy emphasis on learning about the complex data/system under study, which it does by (a) identifying and forecasting major and minor clusters/trends; (b) visualizing their complex causality; and (c) simulating scenarios for potential interventions. COMPLEX-IT is accessible through the web or can be run locally and is powered by R and the Shiny web framework.","Finally, the work will include an investigation of the contextual form of explanations. In this study, we will include a time-bounded scenario in which the different levels of understanding will be tested to enable us to evaluate suitable and comprehensible explanations. For this we have proposed different levels of understanding (LOU). A user study will be designed to compare different LOU for different contexts of interaction. A user study simultating a hospital environment will be investigated.","Explainability has become an important topic in computer science and artificial intelligence, leading to a subfield called Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The goal of providing or seeking explanations is to achieve (better) 'understanding' on the part of the explainee. However, what it means to 'understand' is still not clearly defined, and the concept itself is rarely the subject of scientific investigation. This conceptual article aims to present a model of forms of understanding in the context of XAI and beyond. From an interdisciplinary perspective bringing together computer science, linguistics, sociology, and psychology, a definition of understanding and its forms, assessment, and dynamics during the process of giving everyday explanations are explored. Two types of understanding are considered as possible outcomes of explanations, namely enabledness, 'knowing how' to do or decide something, and comprehension, 'knowing that' -- both in different degrees (from shallow to deep). Explanations regularly start with shallow understanding in a specific domain and can lead to deep comprehension and enabledness of the explanandum, which we see as a prerequisite for human users to gain agency. In this process, the increase of comprehension and enabledness are highly interdependent. Against the background of this systematization, special challenges of understanding in XAI are discussed."
What’s a thoughtful way to respond to criticism?,"To promote constructive discussion of controversial topics online, we propose automatic reframing of disagreeing responses to signal receptiveness to a preceding comment. Drawing on research from psychology, communications, and linguistics, we identify six strategies for reframing. We automatically reframe replies to comments according to each strategy, using a Reddit dataset. Through human-centered experiments, we find that the replies generated with our framework are perceived to be significantly more receptive than the original replies and a generic receptiveness baseline. We illustrate how transforming receptiveness, a particular social science construct, into a computational framework, can make LLM generations more aligned with human perceptions. We analyze and discuss the implications of our results, and highlight how a tool based on our framework might be used for more teachable and creative content moderation.",In this communication we refute a criticism concerning results of our work [3] that was presented in references [1] and [2].,"While peer review enhances writing and research quality, harsh feedback can frustrate and demotivate authors. Hence, it is essential to explore how critiques should be delivered to motivate authors and enable them to keep iterating their work. In this study, we explored the impact of appending an automatically generated positive summary to the peer reviews of a writing task, alongside varying levels of overall evaluations (high vs. low), on authors' feedback reception, revision outcomes, and motivation to revise. Through a 2x2 online experiment with 137 participants, we found that adding an AI-reframed positive summary to otherwise harsh feedback increased authors' critique acceptance, whereas low overall evaluations of their work led to increased revision efforts. We discuss the implications of using AI in peer feedback, focusing on how AI-driven critiques can influence critique acceptance and support research communities in fostering productive and friendly peer feedback practices."

How can someone stay focused in a noisy or distracting environment?,"Cognitive distraction and measurement noise are two distinct factors that significantly impact the performance of humans and engineering systems. Cognitive distraction occurs when an individual's attention is diverted from a task, while measurement noise refers to the random variation that can occur in system measurements. Although humans and engineering systems employ different methods to overcome these obstacles, the ultimate goal is to achieve optimal performance. An intriguing question arises: what are the similarities and differences between using the term ""noise"" in engineering and cognitive psychology? Additionally, it is worthwhile to explore whether the human brain and engineering control systems use similar or different approaches to attenuate noise. While this article does not provide a definitive answer, it emphasizes the importance of addressing this question and encourages further investigation.","Paying close attention to something: Not that easy, is it? It's because our attention is pulled in so many different directions at a time, and it's in fact pretty impressive if you can stay focused.Many people think that attention is all about what we are focusing on, but it's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out.There are two ways you direct your attention. First, there's overt attention. In overt attention, you move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it. Then there's covert attention. In covert attention, you pay attention to something, but without moving your eyes. Think of driving for a second. Your overt attention, your direction of the eyes, are in front, but that's your covert attention which is constantly scanning the surrounding area, where you don't actually look at them.I'm a computational neuroscientist, and I work on cognitive brain-machine interfaces, or bringing together the brain and the computer. I love brain patterns. Brain patterns are important for us because based on them we can build models for the computers, and based on these models computers can recognize how well our brain functions. And if it doesn't function well, then these computers themselves can be used as assistive devices for therapies. But that also means something, because choosing the wrong patterns will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies. Right? In case of attention, the fact that we can shift our attention not only by","The ability to focus one's attention underlies success in many everyday tasks, but voluntary attention cannot be sustained for a long period of time. Several studies indicate that attention training using computer-based exercises can lead to improved attention in children and adults. a major goal of recent research is to create a short (10 minutes) and effective VR Mindfulness meditation particularly designed for regaining or improving sustained attention. In this study, we have created a custom virtually relaxing environment including an archery game with multiple targets. In the experiment, the attention span of 12 adults are tested before and after the virtual reality session by a non-action video game ([19]) score and Muse headband EEG-signals. After the 10-minute virtual reality session participants' game scores increased (according to game experience): for the beginner by 275%, for intermediate by 107%, and for an expert by 17%. For Muse headband data, calm points increased by 250% irrespective of the participants gaming experiences. After the experiment, all participants reported feeling recharged to continue their daily activities."
What are the key elements of a successful blog?,"This paper examines the emerging phenomenon of blogging, using three different Polish blogging services as the base of the research. Authors show that blog networks are sharing their characteristics with complex networks gamma coefficients, small worlds, cliques, etc.). Elements of sociometric analysis were used to prove existence of some social structures in the blog networks.","Blogs have recently become one of the most favored services on the Web. Many users maintain a blog and write posts to express their opinion, experience and knowledge about a product, an event and every subject of general or specific interest. More users visit blogs to read these posts and comment them. This ""participatory journalism"" of blogs has such an impact upon the masses that Keller and Berry argued that through blogging ""one American in tens tells the other nine how to vote, where to eat and what to buy"" \cite{keller1}. Therefore, a significant issue is how to identify such influential bloggers. This problem is very new and the relevant literature lacks sophisticated solutions, but most importantly these solutions have not taken into account temporal aspects for identifying influential bloggers, even though the time is the most critical aspect of the Blogosphere. This article investigates the issue of identifying influential bloggers by proposing two easily computed blogger ranking methods, which incorporate temporal aspects of the blogging activity. Each method is based on a specific metric to score the blogger's posts. The first metric, termed MEIBI, takes into consideration the number of the blog post's inlinks and its comments, along with the publication date of the post. The second metric, MEIBIX, is used to score a blog post according to the number and age of the blog post's inlinks and its comments. These methods are evaluated against the state-of-the-art influential blogger identification method utilizing data collected from a real-world community blog site. The obtained results attest that the new methods are able to better identify significant temporal patterns in the blogging behaviour.","Blogs have become one of the most successful tools of the Web 2.0 because of their ease of use and the availability of open platforms. They have quickly spread in the education field thanks to the many attractive qualities that have been attributed to them, such as collaboration, communication, enhancing of professional writing, and the improvement of information-gathering skills. However, many of the studies that have addressed this issue were not based on an empirical research, and therefore they are unreliable. On the other hand, the studies that do have conducted an empirical research have usually relied on participant self-reported data (surveys, interviews, and contents of blogs), which can significantly bias the positive results usually reported on the use of blogs. Another source of bias and inaccuracy in the reported results is that most of the studies lacked control group, i.e they do not follow an experimental design. The purpose of this review is to examine the current state of the studies related to the evaluation of the blog effects in the education field. The methods to select the studies and perform the corresponding analysis have followed a qualitative systematic approach. The selection has been restricted to empirical and peer-reviewed studies published between January 2011 and June 2013. The findings have been integrated and compared using the Grounded Theory, giving rise to a set of categories that have structured the results of the review."

However, increasing climate change impacts necessitate these buildings to be sustainable, resilient, and zero CO2 emissions. By producing five scenarios (plus existing buildings) with constant floor areas, we investigated how building and district form with building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) affect energy consumption and production, self-sufficiency, CO2 emission, and energy costs in the context of waterfront redevelopment in Tokyo. From estimated hourly electricity demands of the buildings, techno-economic analyses are conducted for rooftop PV systems for 2018 and 2030 with declining costs of rooftop PV systems. We found that environmental building designs with rooftop PV system are increasingly economical in Tokyo with CO2 emission reduction of 2-9% that depends on rooftop sizes. Payback periods drop from 14 years in 2018 to 6 years in 2030. Toward net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, immediate actions are necessary to install rooftop PVs on existing and new buildings with energy efficiency improvements by construction industry and building owners. To facilitate such actions, national and local governments need to adopt appropriate policies."
Share your skincare routine that works for sensitive skin.,"Skin conditions affect an estimated 1.9 billion people worldwide. A shortage of dermatologists causes long wait times and leads patients to seek dermatologic care from general practitioners. However, the diagnostic accuracy of general practitioners has been reported to be only 0.24-0.70 (compared to 0.77-0.96 for dermatologists), resulting in referral errors, delays in care, and errors in diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we developed a deep learning system (DLS) to provide a differential diagnosis of skin conditions for clinical cases (skin photographs and associated medical histories). The DLS distinguishes between 26 skin conditions that represent roughly 80% of the volume of skin conditions seen in primary care. The DLS was developed and validated using de-identified cases from a teledermatology practice serving 17 clinical sites via a temporal split: the first 14,021 cases for development and the last 3,756 cases for validation. On the validation set, where a panel of three board-certified dermatologists defined the reference standard for every case, the DLS achieved 0.71 and 0.93 top-1 and top-3 accuracies respectively. For a random subset of the validation set (n=963 cases), 18 clinicians reviewed the cases for comparison. On this subset, the DLS achieved a 0.67 top-1 accuracy, non-inferior to board-certified dermatologists (0.63, p<0.001), and higher than primary care physicians (PCPs, 0.45) and nurse practitioners (NPs, 0.41). The top-3 accuracy showed a similar trend: 0.90 DLS, 0.75 dermatologists, 0.60 PCPs, and 0.55 NPs. These results highlight the potential of the DLS to augment general practitioners to accurately diagnose skin conditions by suggesting differential diagnoses that may not have been considered. Future work will be needed to prospectively assess the clinical impact of using this tool in actual clinical workflows.",The original method of treatment of various pathological processes in human skin covers is described. The method has a brightly expressed differential action: destroying pathologic cells it does not render any influence on healthy cells. The examples of application of a method for treatment of some kinds of skin pathologies are given.,"Direct and alternating current iontophoresis and electro-osmosis methodologies have provided new methods of transcutaneous drug delivery. A byproduct of such methods is lowering the electrical impedance of the electrode to skin contact, as conductive ions permeate the stratum corneum, the primary resistive layer of the skin. We developed a method for adapting iontophoresis to condition the electrode to skin contact, both for electrophysiological recording and electrical stimulation of body tissues. By utilizing direct current to treat electrodes with high impedance we show the effectiveness of iontopheresis as a driving force for permeation of ionic electrolyte into the skin barrier. We applied direct current (DC) levels of 50 {\mu}A to electrodes on the human head for 30 seconds with paste (Nihon Kohden Elefix) electrolyte. Typically immediately after DC treatment conditioning there was an impedance drop of 10-30%. The effect was lasting over several hours, with the paste electrolyte. These results demonstrate the feasibility of DC conditioning to reduce the set time of electrolytic solutions and to maintain good skin contact during extended recording or stimulation sessions."
Share some advice you’d give to your younger self just starting college.,"Getting a college education is a 20-year investment. When you're growing up poor, you're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead. Instead, you're thinking about where you're going to get your next meal and how your family is going to pay rent that month. Besides, my parents and my friends' parents seemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors. It wasn't until I was a teenager when I realized I didn't want to do those things. By then, I was two-thirds of the way through my education, and it was almost too late to turn things around.When you grow up poor, you want to be rich. I was no different. I'm the second-oldest of seven, and was raised by a single mother on government aid in Queens, New York. By virtue of growing up low-income, my siblings and I went to some of New York City's most struggling public schools. I had over 60 absences when I was in seventh grade, because I didn't feel like going to class. My high school had a 55 percent graduation rate, and even worse, only 20 percent of the kids graduating were college-ready.When I actually did make it to college, I told my friend Brennan how our teachers would always ask us to raise our hands if we were going to college. I was taken aback when Brennan said, ""Karim, I've never been asked that question before."" It was always, ""What college are you going to?""

What makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder — students of color, students underrepresented in selected areas. And what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students, students from low-income backgrounds, to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering.And so I begin with a story about my childhood. We all are products of our childhood experiences. It's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama, a kid who loved getting A's, a kid who loved math, who loved to read, a kid who would say to the teacher — when the teacher said, ""Here are 10 problems,"" to the class, this little fat kid would say, ""Give us 10 more."" And the whole class would say, ""Shut up, Freeman."" And there was a designated kicker every day. And so I was always asking this question: ""Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?""And amazingly, one week in church, when I really didn't want to be there and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems, I heard this man say this: ""If we can get the children"

Describe the vibe of autumn in a small European village.,Whispers of inspiration from the rustling leaves in a serene forest.,Whispers of inspiration from the rustling leaves in a serene forest.,"Different people and cultures associate different emotional states to different parts and spaces of cities. These vary according to individuals, their cultures and also to the time of day, day of week, season, special occasions and more. Recurring patterns may occur in correspondence of the places in which people work, study, entertain themselves, consume, relate, wait or just take a break. What can we learn from these patterns? Trying to find possible answers to this question passes through the possibility to visualize and represent the configurations of emotional expressions in urban spaces, across time, geography, theme, cultures and other dimensions. We have developed ways in which it is possible to harvest people's geo-located (or geo-locatable) emotional expressions from major social networks and to visualize them according to a variety of different modalities. In this paper we will present a series of these types of visualizations, and the ways in which they can be used to gain better understandings of these emotional patterns as they arise, from points of view which derive from anthropology, urbanism, sociology, politics and also arts and poetics. The paper will focus on the ways in which the data is harvested from different social networks, then categorized and annotated with meta-data describing the emotional states, the languages in which people express themselves, the geographic locations, the themes expressed. A methodology for representing this information across a variety of domains (time, space, emotion, theme) will then be presented in detail. A reflection on possible usage cases for anthropology, urbanism, policy-making, arts and design will end the contribution, as well as the description of series of open issues and the indication of possible next-steps for research."

What are the biggest culture shocks when moving to New York City?,"This paper continues to highlight trends in mobility and sociability in New York City (NYC), and supplements them with similar data from Seattle, WA, two of the cities most affected by COVID-19 in the U.S. Seattle may be further along in its recovery from the pandemic and ensuing lockdown than NYC, and may offer some insights into how travel patterns change. Finally, some preliminary findings from cities in China are discussed, two months following the lifting of their lockdowns, to offer a glimpse further into the future of recovery.","New York has become one of the worst-affected COVID-19 hotspots and a pandemic epicenter due to the ongoing crisis. This paper identifies the impact of the pandemic and the effectiveness of government policies on human mobility by analyzing multiple datasets available at both macro and micro levels for the New York City. Using data sources related to population density, aggregated population mobility, public rail transit use, vehicle use, hotspot and non-hotspot movement patterns, and human activity agglomeration, we analyzed the inter-borough and intra-borough moment for New York City by aggregating the data at the borough level. We also assessed the internodal population movement amongst hotspot and non-hotspot points of interest for the month of March and April 2020. Results indicate a drop of about 80% in people's mobility in the city, beginning in mid-March. The movement to and from Manhattan showed the most disruption for both public transit and road traffic. The city saw its first case on March 1, 2020, but disruptions in mobility can be seen only after the second week of March when the shelter in place orders was put in effect. Owing to people working from home and adhering to stay-at-home orders, Manhattan saw the largest disruption to both inter- and intra-borough movement. But the risk of spread of infection in Manhattan turned out to be high because of higher hotspot-linked movements. The stay-at-home restrictions also led to an increased population density in Brooklyn and Queens as people were not commuting to Manhattan. Insights obtained from this study would help policymakers better understand human behavior and their response to the news and governmental policies.","In the face of a pandemic, urban protests, and an affordability crisis, is the desirability of dense urban settings at a turning point? Assessing cities' long term trends remains challenging. The first part of this chapter describes the short-run dynamics of the housing market in 2020. Evidence from prices and price-to-rent ratios suggests expectations of resilience. Zip-level evidence suggests a short-run trend towards suburbanization, and some impacts of urban protests on house prices. The second part of the chapter analyzes the long-run dynamics of urban growth between 1970 and 2010. It analyzes what, in such urban growth, is explained by short-run shocks as opposed to fundamentals such as education, industrial specialization, industrial diversification, urban segregation, and housing supply elasticity. This chapter's original results as well as a large established body of literature suggest that fundamentals are the key drivers of growth. The chapter illustrates this finding with two case studies: the New York City housing market after September 11, 2001; and the San Francisco Bay Area in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Both areas rebounded strongly after these shocks, suggesting the resilience of the urban metropolis."
How do you build a morning routine that actually sticks?,Well good morning early birds.. t minus 47 mins until thee clock out. Then breakfast shower rub one and sleep!,"Human activities follow daily, weekly, and seasonal rhythms. The emergence of these rhythms is related to physiology and natural cycles as well as social constructs. The human body and biological functions undergo near 24-hour rhythms (circadian rhythms). The frequency of these rhythms is more or less similar across people, but its phase is different. In the chronobiology literature, based on the propensity to sleep at different hours of the day, people are categorized into morning-type, evening-type, and intermediate-type groups called \textit{chronotypes}. This typology is typically based on carefully designed questionnaires or manually crafted features drawing on data on timings of people's activity. Here we develop a fully data-driven (unsupervised) method to decompose individual temporal activity patterns into components. This has the advantage of not including any predetermined assumptions about sleep and activity hours, but the results are fully context-dependent and determined by the most prominent features of the activity data. Using a year-long dataset from mobile phone screen usage logs of 400 people, we find four emergent temporal components: morning activity, night activity, evening activity and activity at noon. Individual behavior can be reduced to weights on these four components. We do not observe any clear emergent categories of people based on the weights, but individuals are rather placed on a continuous spectrum according to the timings of their activities. High loads on morning and night components highly correlate with going to bed and waking up times. Our work points towards a data-driven way of categorizing people based on their full daily and weekly rhythms of activity and behavior, rather than focusing mainly on the timing of their sleeping periods.",tired and beleives early mornings should be illegal!
Talk about a life lesson you learned from traveling solo.,"Embarked on a solo travel adventure, discovering the beauty of new places at my own pace. #SoloTravel #SeniorExplorer","I'm a lifelong traveler. Even as a little kid, I was actually working out that it would be cheaper to go to boarding school in England than just to the best school down the road from my parents' house in California. So, from the time I was nine years old I was flying alone several times a year over the North Pole, just to go to school. And of course the more I flew the more I came to love to fly, so the very week after I graduated from high school, I got a job mopping tables so that I could spend every season of my 18th year on a different continent. And then, almost inevitably, I became a travel writer so my job and my joy could become one. And I really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the candlelit temples of Tibet or to wander along the seafronts in Havana with music passing all around you, you could bring those sounds and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home, and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life. Except, as you all know, one of the first things you learn when you travel is that nowhere is magical unless you can bring the right eyes to it. You take an angry man to the Himalayas, he just starts complaining about the food. And I found that the best way that I could develop more attentive and more appreciative eyes was, oddly, by going nowhere, just by sitting still. And of course sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives, a break. But it","I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person, so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things. And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible. I became one of the working homeless. I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel. His death hit me pretty hard. And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip. So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things. One: that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person. Two: I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it. Three: I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle.At first, living in the van was great. I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly. And I had time to relax and to grieve. But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in. My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills. What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer. And it became impossible to park anywhere — (Laughs) — without being very obv"

What’s your unpopular opinion about working from home?,"Although the pandemic times of the world-wide forced working from home seem to be in the past, many knowledge workers choose to continue working predominantly from home as a partial or permanent practice. Related studies show that employees of companies from various industries, diverse in size and location, prefer to alter working in the office with working at home, coined as hybrid or flexible working arrangements. As a result, the post-pandemic times are associated with empty offices, confused managers and organizational leaders not knowing what to do with the often-expensive rental contracts. In this paper, we investigate the employee presence in the offices in two software companies and dive deeper into the reasons behind the preferences to work remotely, practices that help to attract employees back into the offices and, in cases when this is not possible, the ways companies can repurpose the office space for the future needs of their employees. The latter are based on the qualitative analysis of interviews and survey responses. Our findings suggest that since the fall 2021 the offices were half-empty and that, on average, the daily office presence varies between 15-30%. The reasons for working remotely include behavioural and practical motivations, as well as factors related to office equipment and facilities, and the nature of the work tasks. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our findings on the future work arrangements.","Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, employees from around the world were compelled to work remotely from home and, in many cases, without much preparation. A substantial body of international research has been conducted on the experiences and attitudes of remote workers as well as the implications of this phenomenon for organisations. While New Zealand research evidence is growing, most existing inquiry is qualitative. This paper provides a quantitative snapshot of remote working using survey data from participants whose jobs can be done from home (n=415). Data collection took place when the country was facing Covid-related measures. Based on descriptive and inferential statistics, it was found that, not only was remote working common, but that hybrid working arrangements were also more prevalent. While half of the participants wanted to work from home more frequently, age, but not gender, was significantly associated with this preference. Another relevant finding is that perceived change in the workplace culture due to flexible work arrangements was significantly associated with preference for working remotely more often. Finally, the most common perceived barriers to working from home were slow internet speed, the need to attend face-to-face meetings, and limited space at home to work. The implications of the results are discussed and some directions for future research are proposed.","In early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced employees in tech companies worldwide to abruptly transition from working in offices to working from their homes. During two years of predominantly working from home, employees and managers alike formed expectations about what post-pandemic working life should look like. Many companies are currently experimenting with new work policies that balance both employee- and manager expectations to where, when and how work should be done in the future. In this article, we gather experiences from 17 companies and their sites, covering 12 countries. We share the results of corporate surveys of employee preferences for working from home and analyse new work policies. Our results are threefold. First, through the new work policies all companies are formally giving more flexibility to the employees with regards to working time and work location. Second, there is a great variation in how much flexibility the companies are willing to yield to the employees. The variation is related both to industry type, size of the companies, and company culture. Third, we document a change in the psychological contract between employees and managers, where the option of working from home is converted from an exclusive perk that managers could choose to give to the few, to a core privilege that all employees feel they are entitled to. Finally, there are indications that as the companies learn and solicit feedback regarding the efficiency of the chosen strategies, we might see further developments and changes of the work policies with respect to how much flexibility to work whenever and from anywhere they grant. Through these findings, the paper contributes to a growing literature about the new trends emerging from the pandemic in tech companies and spells out practical implications onwards."
How can someone decorate their apartment with thrift store finds,Embarked on a DIY home decor project. Let's hope it turns out better than last time. #DIYAdventure #TeenHomeDecor,"Fashion recommendation has witnessed a phenomenal growth of research, particularly in the domains of shop-the-look, contextaware outfit creation, personalizing outfit creation etc. Majority of the work in this area focuses on better understanding of the notion of complimentary relationship between lifestyle items. Quite recently, some works have realised that style plays a vital role in fashion, especially in the understanding of compatibility learning and outfit creation. In this paper, we would like to present the end-to-end design of a methodology in which we aim to generate outfits guided by styles or themes using a novel style encoder network. We present an extensive analysis of different aspects of our method through various experiments. We also provide a demonstration api to showcase the ability of our work in generating outfits based on an anchor item and styles.",And where do you think unsold items from thrift stores go?

Give me a fashion tip for styling oversized clothes.,"Outfittery is an online personalized styling service targeted at men. We have hundreds of stylists who create thousands of bespoke outfits for our customers every day. A critical challenge faced by our stylists when creating these outfits is selecting an appropriate item of clothing that makes sense in the context of the outfit being created, otherwise known as style fit. Another significant challenge is knowing if the item is relevant to the customer based on their tastes, physical attributes and price sensitivity. At Outfittery we leverage machine learning extensively and combine it with human domain expertise to tackle these challenges. We do this by surfacing relevant items of clothing during the outfit building process based on what our stylist is doing and what the preferences of our customer are. In this paper we describe one way in which we help our stylists to tackle style fit for a particular item of clothing and its relevance to an outfit. A thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation highlights the method's ability to recommend fashion items by style fit.","Virtual try-on (VTO) applications aim to improve the online shopping experience by allowing users to preview garments, before making purchase decisions. However, many VTO tools fail to consider the crucial relationship between a garment's size and the user's body size, often employing a one-size-fits-all approach when visualizing a clothing item. This results in poor size recommendations and purchase decisions leading to increased return rates. To address this limitation, we introduce SiCo, an online VTO system, where users can upload images of themselves and visualize how different sizes of clothing would look on their body to help make better-informed purchase decisions. Our user study shows SiCo's superiority over baseline VTO. The results indicate that our approach significantly enhances user ability to gauge the appearance of outfits on their bodies and boosts their confidence in selecting clothing sizes that match desired goals. Based on our evaluation, we believe our VTO design has the potential to reduce return rates and enhance the online clothes shopping experience.

How do you feel?"" These sound kind of meaningless, right? And, in some ways, they are. They have no semantic meaning. It doesn't matter how you are or what the day is like. They have something else. They have social meaning. What we mean when we say those things is: I see you there.I'm obsessed with talking to strangers. I make eye contact, say hello, I offer help, I listen. I get all kinds of stories. About seven years ago, I started documenting my experiences to try to figure out why. What I found was that something really beautiful was going on. This is almost poetic. These were really profound experiences. They were unexpected pleasures. They were genuine emotional connections. They were liberating moments.So one day, I was standing on a corner waiting for the light to change, which, I'm a New Yorker, so that means I was actually standing in the street on the storm drain, as if that could get me across faster.

You might disappear."" So this is absurd, right? But I did what he said. I stepped back onto the sidewalk. And he smiled, and he said, ""Good. You never know. I might have turned around, and zoop, you're gone.""This was weird, and also really won"
Share some tips for building confidence in front of the camera.,"We consider the question of how to best achieve the perception of eye contact when a person is captured by camera and then rendered on a 2D display. For single subjects photographed by a camera, conventional wisdom tells us that looking directly into the camera achieves eye contact. Through empirical user studies, we show that it is instead preferable to {\em look just below the camera lens}. We quantitatively assess where subjects should direct their gaze relative to a camera lens to optimize the perception that they are making eye contact.","Camera pose estimation in large-scale environments is still an open question and, despite recent promising results, it may still fail in some situations. The research so far has focused on improving subcomponents of estimation pipelines, to achieve more accurate poses. However, there is no guarantee for the result to be correct, even though the correctness of pose estimation is critically important in several visual localization applications,such as in autonomous navigation. In this paper we bring to attention a novel research question, pose confidence estimation,where we aim at quantifying how reliable the visually estimated pose is. We develop a novel confidence measure to fulfil this task and show that it can be flexibly applied to different datasets,indoor or outdoor, and for various visual localization pipelines.We also show that the proposed techniques can be used to accomplish a secondary goal: improving the accuracy of existing pose estimation pipelines. Finally, the proposed approach is computationally light-weight and adds only a negligible increase to the computational effort of pose estimation.",Trying to learn some &quot;PHOTOGRAPHY&quot;

The data presented here are collected from 37 countries across all continents for eight source groups, including three types of fossil sources (coal, gas, and oil), nuclear energy and four groups of renewable energy sources (solar energy, wind energy, hydro energy and other renewables including biomass, geothermal, etc.). The global near-real-time power dataset shows the dynamics of the global power system, including its hourly, daily, weekly and seasonal patterns as influenced by daily periodical activities, weekends, seasonal cycles, regular and irregular events (i.e., holidays) and extreme events (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic). The Carbon Monitor-Power dataset reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic caused strong disruptions in some countries (i.e., China and India), leading to a temporary or long-lasting shift to low carbon intensity, while it had only little impact in some other countries (i.e., Australia). This dataset offers a large range of opportunities for power-related scientific research and policy-making."
